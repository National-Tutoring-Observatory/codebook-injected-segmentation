hello?
hi
hi again
did you need more help
i came across another question that i need help with
okay is it the one already written
yes
okay what is the prime factorization of 216
2 and 108
remember prime factorization can only have prime numbers
108 can be simplified further
3 and 36
remember what i did earlier
yes
see 2 and 108
now you need to simplify 108
thats closer
but 36 can be simplified
oh 3 and 3
am i right
what two numbers multiply to 36
not quite
6 and 6
okay good
now how can 6 be simplified
3 and 3
3 times 3 is 9
3,2
yes
so if you look at the board
uh
im so sorry
i deleted it by accident
it ok
okay so looking at my chart
how many 2's are there
thers is 4 2<s
are you sure you counted correctly
no wait 2 2's
almost
i circled them in red
3 2's
yes
and how many 3's are there
2 3's
almost
3 3's ?
yes
are you counting what i am counting?
yes
okay
so thus the prime factorization of 216 is 2^3 times 3^3
does that make sense
yes
did that make sense
yes that makes more sense
okay
and the v
since it is not squared
it can not be taken out of the square root
it stays the same
yes
exactly
so you're basically simplifying the 216 only not the v since it is not squared
yes
you should always prime factorize numbers if they are not already prime
otherwise you can not see you can take out 6 from the root
what do you mean
?
by taking out the 6 from the square root
from the prime factorization i saw there was a 6^2
the square root of 6^2 is 6
so that is why it is on the left side of the root
oh that clears everything
i get it now
okay that's great
thanks for the help again
no problems
have a good night :)
