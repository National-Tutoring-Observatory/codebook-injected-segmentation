Hi! How can I help you?
95% of $71 ? Is that what you wrote?
45% of 71$
Ok great!
Are you allowed to use a calculator?
yes
Ok, do you know what 45% would be as a decimal?
0.45?
Awesome!
so in your calculator you can do 0.41 * 71
*.45
3.15 is what i got
Check the decimal places: are you sure you're multiplying .45 by 71?
31.95?
you can do a quick check on your answer. 45% is almost half, right?
so half of 71 bucks should be BIG!
imagine how annoyed you'd be if you only got 3 bucks when you were supposed to get half of 71 :)
yes, that's right!
Awesome job
it it was wrong
it said it was wrong
Did the instructions tell you to round?
You put in 31.95 and it said that was wrong?
Let's double check all the numbers in the question. It said to do 45% times $71.00 ? And it didn't tell you any specific instructions for rounding?
An item on sale costs 75% of the original price. The original price was 65$ next question
it jumped me to the next question
What does it say it is asking for?
calculate to find the sales price
Ok so this one should be the same thing. In your calculator, multiply 0.75 by 65.00
Does it say anything about rounding?
no
gives me 48.75
That's right!
Nice job
Did it say the answer was correct when you put it in this time?
yes
Great!
I think on the first question, maybe it was asking for the discount amount, not the sale price
You also have to be very careful about the wording they use
for example, if it said: "The item is 45% off." , the answer would be different than if it say "The item is 45% of its original price."
