Find the values of x and y
hello
Hi - What can I help you with?
i need help finding y
i know that x is 40
but can't figure out what y is
Y is the angle you're looking for in the bottom right corner?
yes
Is that a right angle where X and Y meet?
angle
the problem doesn't say that it is a right angle
Is there any way you can upload the problem?
Do those orange marks mean anything?
i dont know
that was in the problem
Can you take a picture of the problem with your phone and upload it to the site??
im using my laptop and i can't take a photo on my laptop
the camera isn't working
Can you do a screenshot?
it's in a textbook (the question)
OK
I'm trying to draw on the whiteboard but it isn't working...
i dont think its working
try to check ur connection
Gosh - I'm really sorry.
it okay
I just need to know what I'm looking at.
let me check my connection real quick
Does the bottom right corner APPEAR to be a 90 degree angle?
yes
it just didn't have the indicator
OK, let's assume it is. If x = 40, then what would Y be?
it would be 50
That's right! I'd go with that answer
okay
thanks
