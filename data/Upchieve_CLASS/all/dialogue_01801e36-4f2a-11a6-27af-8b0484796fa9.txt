Hi, I need help with is factoring problems with binomials and trinomials. Can you please give me problems to work on?
Hi!
Not a problem!
Thank You!
Just to confirm, you want me to give you some problems to work on
Yes please
Or do you have problems you need to work on
Oh okay!
Give me one second
Okay, No problem
Okay
So let's here is a trinomial problem
x^2+4x-32
Hi i don't know why the marker is doing that but i will try to do on paper and send it
Hey no problem
Is this correct?
Yes!
You got it!
Can you give me a slightly harder one?
Okay!
-2x^3-6x^2+56x
Okay now I need help how to start it
Okay not a problem!
Did the screen just go blank? Haha
Yeah it did haha
haha okay
Let me rewrite the problem really quickly
Okay
So first, what part do you get stuck on
Or at least, what do you think you should be doing, but can't because the problem looks weird
I got stuck on how I will find the multiplies of 56 that will add up to 6
I was thinking of multiplying 56 and -2 and find a factor that will add to -6
Okay!
Can you elaborate a little on what you mean by multiplying 56 and -2
Like finding factors like 2 and 8to see if that will add up to -6
Ah
I see
Oh!!!
Look at you
Good job! One piece of advice, you just factored out -2x, make sure all your signs inside the parentheses are correct!
Is this correct?
Awesome!
Yup you got it
I was just making sure you saw that it should have been x^2+3x-28, not +28
But you still ended up with the right answer
So good job!!!
Okay thats great! Can you write be binomial problem?
Yup!
Sorry!
It is taking a while to find a good binomial problem
Okay it's fine!
Okay
So let's start with an easy one
x^2-4
Is this correct?
Yup!
You got it
But a problem that I need help with x^2-5x
Ooo okay
So let's do that one
Write it out on the whiteboard
Okay great
so what is your plan
When you see a problem like this what is the first thing you think of doing
I was thinking to put x-5 and x+1
That's the only thing I can think of
Okay I see
So when just like the first or second problem we did
When you pulled out -2x
You should try and see if there are any common factors you can pull out of this equation
Okay
So whenever I have a problem like this, I am supposed to pull out what both variables have in common in this case x
Yea
The first thing you should always try and do is to check if there is a common factor
But look! You solved it :D
Okay and whats is your tip for trinomials
Yes, I sure did!
I would say it follows a similar pattern
Try and factor first
and then use FOIL
but factoring is always a life saver
Okay, thank you very much!
Not a problem!
Here is a great additional resource

These are for polynomials
but go over some good factoring tips

Thank you once again!
Have a great rest of your night
