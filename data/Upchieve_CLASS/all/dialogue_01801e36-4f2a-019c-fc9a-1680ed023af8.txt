hello! how can i help?
doing geometry.
m<4=108 degrees looking for the other 3
which one is m<4?
and are the two lines next to each other parallel?
this is it
oh, okay
so for angles next to each other (such as 4 and 2) they would both add up to 180 degrees
ok
and for angles across from each other (like 4 and 1) they are the same degrees
and for 3 you would follow similar to the first time, as angles 3 and 4 are next to each other
so both 3,1 is 72?
angle 1 would be 71 degrees, but not angle 3
*sorry 72 degrees
ok
glad i can help :)
