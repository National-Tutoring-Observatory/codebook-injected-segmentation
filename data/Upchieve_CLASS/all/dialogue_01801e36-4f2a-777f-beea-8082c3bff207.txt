hello
hi
what do you need help with today
I need help with simplifying radicals with variables
okay
is there a specific problem?
yes kind of
okay show me
the square root of 5121?
my computer froze for a second
sorry about that
oh okay
so it is the square root of 512K^2
yes
okay you know you that the square root cancels any square inside it
did you follow that
yes i did
so what i would do to simplify the square root of 512 is to take the prime factorization of it
do you know what prime factorization is
yes
it is a factor that is also a prime number
well that is an element of it yes
but prime factorization describes the original number as a multiplication of one or more prime numbers
thus the prime factorization of 512 is 2^9
did you follow
ok
i follow
so what i boxed is the final answer
i have another question
what is it
that would be the answer
yes
did that make sense
ok so you found the square root of a 100 and ^3
v^#
yes
my next question is
the square root of v^3 simplified to vrtv
what are P, r, and t
they dont tell me
so assuming it is P times t times P times r times t
i cancelled P from the numerator and denominator
then i simplified t times t as t squared
how did you get t squared
?
these are all possible answers because the order does not matter
i got t squared from  the two t's in the numerator
i got 1+rt
is that a plus sign or a t in the numerator
yes
yes then you are correct
it is 1+rt
ok
so you cancelled dc
cd
yes
because they are in every term
and then divide by 4
yes
oh ok
did that make sense
yes the work was erased though
you cant see any of it?
no
oh
i dont know why
do you need me to rewrite it
yes
do you see that
ok i get it now
okay thats great
do you want to try one
sure
im lost
okay
so your prime factorization of 16 was correct
it is 2^4
so now what you have is
right
hello?
ok
okay so the 2^4 comes out of the square root as 2^2
does that make sense
can u explain it one more time
see my example
that is the rule of square roots right
right
so if we look at 2^4
that is really (2^2)^2
yes
so the square root of it should be 2^2
did you see what i did there
oh that makes more sense
okay
so now lets look at x
it can also be written as x^2 times x right
ok
we know the square root of x^2 is x
therefore i took x^2 out of the root
ok
does that make sense
yes
so now y
the square root of Y^2 is just y
so it comes out of the root
and the simplification is done
Ok thanks for the help i really appreciate it
no problem
come back any time if you have more questions
of course!
goodnight then
yes have a goodnight!
