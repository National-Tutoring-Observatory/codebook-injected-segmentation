hello what would you like help with today?
Hello I am having trouble with two questions from my AP Calc homework
okay sure
So the question is
Which derivative is described by the following expression?
I wrote the equation on the right and the answer choices on the left
are you sure C) and D) are both g(0) and not g'(0)
oh well i guess that doesnt matter
so recall the definition of a derivative
as what i just wrote
since the limit you wrote aligns with the definition of a derivative, you know that the answer must be a derivative
the only answer that is a derivative is A)
furthermore
wait but how is only a the only derivative
like how can you prove that it is a derivative
?
g'(x) is the notation for derivatives
they all have the g'(x) I just couldn't put it there because it kept messing up how the equation looked like
oh that makes more sense
then its B)
so looking at the definition of a derivative
the numerator
aligning it with the numerator of the given
you see that f(x) is 2^x
or g(x) in this case
yeah
and instead of x, there is a 3
so it is the derivative of g(x) at x=3
Wait I am still confused ?
on how i got g(x) or how i know it's x=3
how you know x=3
okay looking at these two equations i just wrote
is it clear that x=3?
like
the function is 2^x
is the second equation f(x+h)=2^3+h
yes? im referring to the two equations in the box
yeah from f(x+h)=2^3+h you got f(x)=2^3
is it b/c you could cancel the h
?
yes you can think of it like that
like you see that f(x)=2^3
then f(x+h) is like putting (x+h) in as x
so if replacing x by x+h gets you 2^(3+h) then you know that the original function must be 2^x
there is no other function it could be
does that make sense
ohhhhh
ok thank you
yes im glad its clear now
yes thank you
is there another question?
no I don't have another question it was just that one thank you again
oh okay
no problem, come back if you have any more questions :)
ok thank you bye
