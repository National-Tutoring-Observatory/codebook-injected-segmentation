hi again
Hi! I had another question
sure
It says "If x-2 is a factor of x^2 -bx +b, where b is a constant, what is that value of b?"
Oh I get it, but how do you find what b is if there isn't another factor?
okay sorry im back
that's okay
there are two ways to solve this problem
one, see the question mark i drew
you can name is some variable and solve for it
it*
does that make sense?
kinda
so you just plug in a random variable and solve the equation for both of them?
yes
oh okay
we know there are two factors, bcs it is a quadratic equation
but we dont know what the other factor is, so i called it a random variable "a"
oh okay I see it now
okay let me show you the other way
so you know one root of the equation is 2 right
yes
so we can solve for b using sum and product of roots
did you learn this
no I don't think so
it's really simple
I'm in algebra 2 and trig but this is algebra 1?
no this is algebra 2
oh okay
so i've written the general form of a quadratic equation
so the sum of its two roots is -b/a
and the product of its two roots is c/a
this is true for all quadratic equations
yes I've known and have been using the sum of the roots for a while and I know that that is used to find the x coordinate of a vertex and can be further used to find the y value
We've never touched on the product of roots
oh okay
now that you know
going back to the other problem, lets say the roots are 2 and some variable "a"
what ive boxed in red is just plugging numbers into the formulas
and now you have a system of equations with two variables and you can solve for b
oh this makes so much more sense
thats good
just like that?
yep
wait
i think you forgot to multiple the first 2 by 2
multiply*
ohh multiplying the entire equation by 2
yea
yes exactly
bad writing
oh alright
no it's all good
so my final answer is just 4?
yea
yay! Thank you so much you are so great!
aw thank you!
Don't be surprised if you see me on here again, my teacher has no mercy
hope you find the topic easier now :)
Thank you!
of course
