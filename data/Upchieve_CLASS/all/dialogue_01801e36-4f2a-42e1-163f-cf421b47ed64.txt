Hi again!
hi still on the same problem
Alright so as I said before
all angles in a triangle add up to 180˚
yea 180
so the whole angle is 180 degrees?
so if the angles we have are 57˚, 89˚, and x˚, and they all add up to 180˚ what would the equation be be
so we have to add up all the angles that we know and set that equal to 180. Like this: x+57+89=180
When you do that you should be able to solve for x
it would simplify to x+146=180
so to isolate x and get it by itself on one side, you subtract 146 on both sides
which means that the x = 180-146 = 34
ok thanks i got it
no problem! let me know if theres anything else
ok appreciate it
i got 16
16 for which problem?
the triangle one?
yes
It should be 34. It cannot be 16 because 16+57+89 is not 180
i subtracted 180 from 146
Right so 180-146 is 34
it would actually be subtracting 146 from 180 instead of the other way around
ok
-34
no it shouldn't be a negative number
an angle cannot be negative so it has to be positive 34
yes thats what i go in the beginning
but u said switch it around at it was -34
so is that it?
oh right so what I meant is, when you say subtract 180 from 146, it means that you are doing 146-180. So what should actually be said is "subtract 146 from 180" because that means you are taking 146 away from 180 so it would be 180-146
yep thats all. That should be the right answer
thanks
No problem
hey i need help again.
Sure whats the problem
all the numbers are cm
so is the ? ,mark what you are truing to fid?
find*
I re drew it just to make sure I have the right information
did they provide you with any other numbers?
