hi what can i help you with today?
hi i need help on my math homework
it's on the factor theorem and the remainder theorem.
it's as follows:
Create a polynomial p(x) which has the desired characteristics. You may leave the polynomial in factored form.
(i) the zeros of p are c=2, and c=-2, and c=-1, and c=1
(ii) The leading term of p(x) is 117x^2
There
How do i do this?
okay
is this a single problem?
since there are 4 zeroes, the leading term should be x^4
yeah i am confused by that too
do you think it could be a typo
i dont think so, my teacher didn't say anything about it
i think it is impossible to have 4 roots with a quadratic equation
ill draw out what i tried
actually it was someone else's idea but neither she nor i have any idea if it's right
hm
the only problem i have with this is that it does not look like a polynomial function
oh okay. do you have any other ideas? im kind of lost
honestly i think it's just a typo
maybe she meant any type of function
because then this would be the answer
what kind of function is this then?
a rational function
what is a rational function?
a rational function is a function with polynomials on the numerator and denominator
so no other ideas?
if it isn't a typo i mean
i just don't think it's possible
oh okay then. thanks for trying.
sorry im not the teacher so i cant tell you if it should be something else
but if it doesnt fit the rules, dont be afraid to question the question
oh okay. i will keep that in mind.
im going to end the session now.
thanks!
okay come back if you have any other questions!
