hey
hello!
how are u
i'm doing well :)
me too
so how can i help?
let me find the question again
oke
Find the measurement of angle RST. Hint draw a line through S parallel to RX and TY.
is angle r 40 degrees?
yes
hello
are u still there
i tried to do the problem before and I got 110
i not sure if it's right
to solve, you have to use the parallel lines, and the line that was drawn needs to go through angle RST to figure out the two pieces of RST using congruent angles. i'm not sure if you learned this property yet, but the angles that are corners are congruent (i'll draw an example) also lmk if this sends i had a brief period with no wifi
just got this
but I don't see the example
if you see the angles in red (i think you got it) angles 1 and 2 are congruent
and if you add those two angles they'll make up RST
so it was 110
due to alternate interior angles and angle addition
yep!
is there anything else you need help on?
yes
let me draw it
it not letting me draw it
same question as before
do you have any angles given?
r is 110 and t is 120
is XR and YT parallel?
yes
another property but angle R and 1 are supplementary because they're parallel lines
so it is 90
or is it 110
since 40 and 70 is 110
supplementary is that the two angles add up to 180
so it is 70
yep
just 70
and do the same for angle 2 and YTS
then add angle 1 and 2 to make up RST
that is 40
so 110
is angleYTS 120 or 110?
120
oh 130 is the answer
yeahhh
thank u
no problem!
bye
goodbye
