Given: <1 and <2 are complementary, <3 and <4 are complementary
Prove: <1 is congruent to <4
Hi!
Hi!
Hello

Ok so do you remember the definition of complementary angles?
Ok so do you remember the definition of complementary angles?
Yes lol
Yes it is that the sum of two angles is equal to 90 degrees
Ok great!
Ok great!
So we actually have a lot of info about these triangles already

The sum of ALL the angles in a triangle is 180, right?
The sum of ALL the angles in a triangle is 180, right?
Yes
that means the unlabeled angles must actually be right angles!

So you can see it would be the same for b right?

Yes
Ok great
Ok great
So to write a proof the first two statements would be the givens right?
Yes that's correct!
Yes that's correct!
You can accept the two statements they first gave you as true.

That 1 and 2 are complementary therefore their sum is 90, that 3 and 4 are complementary therefore their sum is 90
That 1 and 2 are complementary therefore their sum is 90, that 3 and 4 are complementary therefore their sum is 90
ok an then how would you figure out the third step to prove <1 = <4
And then you can logically conclude that the unlabeled angels are actually also 90 degrees because 1 + 2 + a should be equal to 180

Ok so

I'm going to redraw the picture for you

no not really

do you just see a line or do you see the full new picture I tried to draw?

i see two lines
Ok got it
Ok got it
is the screen blank now?

no
yes
So sorry about this
So sorry about this
essentially... you know the other unlabeled angles are right angles. so you can REDRAW the picture

try to imagine what it would look like if you redrew the picture so that the unlabeled angles were actually 90 degree angels

t will help you see why 1 and 4 are congruent!

ok thank you so much i understand it
have a good day!
You too! Sorry about the whiteboard issue
