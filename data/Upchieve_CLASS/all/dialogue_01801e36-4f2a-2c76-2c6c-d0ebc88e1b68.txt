Hi!
How can I help you?
Are you drawing on the whiteboard?
yes
sry for some reason i could not type
Hello
Not a problem!
Do you mean you couldn't type in the chat box?
yes
Given: <1 and <2 are complementary; <1 is congruent to <4
Prove: <3 and <4 are complementary
Okay awesome!
Have you finished drawing? It seems a little a laggy on my side
Did you label the angels yet?
*angles
sry now i couldnt draw
can u see that?
I see two lines connected
Hey we are really sorry it is being so slow tonight
i have now labeled the angles
no problem at all
It usually isn't this slow! :)
I'm going to report this technical issue and we will get it fixed ASAP
Now I can see everything!
Okay so first
Do you have any information on the lines? If they're parallel or anything?
yes <2 and <3 are vertical angles
oh you mean the lines whoops
well i guess they intersect?
i feel like i should tell you that my teacher wants the answer in a two column proof
Thanks for telling me!
So is there anything you know about angle A?
it is equal to 90 degrees
Great!
Okay, so part of what is confusing is that there are extra lines here that we don't need that makes it harder to figure out what theorem to use
So <4 and <1 are "alternate interior angles"
It's easier to see if you get rid of the extra line (I'm going to label it line L)
okay
if you imagine that the line wasn't there, you'd be able to see it more clearly
ohh a transversal line?
do see what I drew in the top left corner?
Yup!
the line I'm going to highlight in blue is the transversal line
and angle 1 and 4 are congruent
so you can use the "converse alternate interior angle theorem" to prove something! do you know what it is?
yes \
Ok what does it prove?
like the angles labeled?
BTW earlier you said that 2 and 3 were vertical angles. Is that something that was given to you as part of the problem?
Because if so we can actually solve it even faster I just realized.
no
sry i had to check
Ok so I just confirmed: you can write for your proof the statement "<2 and <3 are congruent" and the reason/rationale is "vertical angles theorem".
That's always the case if they are intersecting
ah i see
So we'll know <2 = <3. AND based off the given info, we know that <1 + <2 = 90 (by definition of complementary), and we know <1 = <4 (by definition of congruent).
So if you plug in values, you can show that <3 + <4 = 90
I got distracted by the lines earlier haha - sorry!!!
these problems are tricky because there's so many different directions you can go to prove stuff. :)
yes i see that made it quicker :) thank you for explaining it to me
no problem!
Sorry it took me a little while too
Can I help with any other questions?
no that's it thank you very much
No problem!
Thank you for being so patient
