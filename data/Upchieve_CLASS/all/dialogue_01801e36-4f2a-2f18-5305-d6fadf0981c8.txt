Pythagorean Theorem
Hey, how can I help you today? is there a specific problem giving you trouble?
well i need help you see because i understand some of it but when it comes to like finding the perimeter its confusing
and yes'
In order to find the perimeter of any shape, all you need to do is add up the lengths of each side of the shape
so if you had a triangle like the one i drew
yea but when i do that it comes out like a decimal and i dont know if im doing it wrong because when my teacher showed me i got it right but you know
yea
also im in 8th grade soooooo
getting a decimal in your answer is perfectly fine! The perimeter of a shape is just how "long" the shape would be if you could turn into a line
yea i guess
what was the problem that you were having trouble with
80^2+60^2=c
What makes you think that you can't have a decimal in your answer? Is it because all the examples you've done in class didn't have one?
I'll help you with the problem as soon as I figure out why its not letting me draw, give me a second. sorry
i did have one but it like for me it has to be to the nearest tenth
oh, yeah. In those cases, you just have to round and it sounds like you know how to do that well already
no not really when its decimals i dont know how
oh okay, you'll definitely be able to pick it up. Do you know where the tenths, hundredths, thousands place are in a decimal number?
like what place is the 2 in .0211
um this is acting dumbbb
I know, the chat keeps glitching for me too
I'll try to stick to the board
when you get asked to round to the nearest hundredth
uhhh sorry
look at the number to the right of it
no worries!
ok
so in the number i wrote on the board
if you were asked to round to the nearest hundredth
you should look at the number to the right of it which in this case is a 2
so you would round down to .01
im sorry but im confused
i can give you another example
okk
for this example
do we put lines in the bottom
first find the number in the 100th place
the 7 and 3
no thats not necessary
oh
i put the line to show which number u should look at
sorry if its confusing
ohh
is the hundredths place on right or left
on the left
oh so do we move one time/
no its even less work than that
oh uhhm iok
you need to compare the number to the right
of the place youre being asked to round to
thats hard
you need to compare it to 5
its bigger
yeah! so you round up
in the second one, 3 is smaller than 5
so you round down
so then?
ohh
if i asked you to round .035
to the nearest hundredth
what would u get
uhhhhhh
0.35
you don't need to move the decimal when rounding
you add one to the place youre being asked to round to
the idea of rounding is to
simplify the number by saying "its kinda closer to this"
we can round the line i drew to the nearest
whole number
what number is the line closest to
oh ok
yeah
so .035 is closer to .040
important thing to remember is to compare
the number to the right of whatever
place youre looking at to 5
if its greater or equal to 5
add one to the place your being asked to round
if its less than 5, drop whatever is to the right
of the place youre being asked to round to
so change the number into a closer higher or lower number
i boxed in the numbers of interest
oo
do you have anymore questions about rounding?
my bad i didnt see your messages
no im good
yes! what you said is correct
you get it now
yes
alright can u send the pythagorean theorem problem
again
uhh what do you mean?
pythagorean theorem problem*
I thought you had another question
no lol
lol my bad
if thats all you need help with then
yea well thanks
im gonna end the session
ok
no problem!
glad i could help
have a nice night
