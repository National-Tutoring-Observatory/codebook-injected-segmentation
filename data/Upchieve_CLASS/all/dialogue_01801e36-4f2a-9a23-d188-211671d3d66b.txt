hi, sorry I cut off the previous session
my connection was a bit weird,, haha but how can I help you?
how can I figure out the initial value?
can you type or write the equation?
20,000(0.86)^t
is there any other information given to you for this problem?
The dollar value (t) of a certain car model that is t years old is given by the following exponential function.  20,000(0.86)^t
did you finish college?
okay, so a way to solve this problem, is that you plug in t = 0, since you're looking for the initial value
no, I'm currently in college
that's good
so like how does this work are you super smart do you get paid for this ?
and when t = 0, time hasn't technically started, thus being the initial value
ah, I volunteer to be a math tutor :-)
and I'd say I'm not super duper smart, but I do pretty well
nice thanks for your help
no problem!
are you gonna be a teacher some day
okay sorry I'll stop wasting your time good luck
I'm not too sure, to be honest.
