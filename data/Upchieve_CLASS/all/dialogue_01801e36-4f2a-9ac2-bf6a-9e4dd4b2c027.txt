Hi! What do you need help with?
factor
Gotcha
Just one minute
for sure
Do you have any ideas about a first step?
the two ys
8 divided by 20?
That's one way of doing it, but I think there's a quicker way
You can always write an equation like this as:
x^2 + (b)xy + (c)y^2
where b = p + q and c = p*q
then you can factor it into:
x^2 + (p+q)xy + (p*q)y^2
so how we getting the answer
Factored form is gonna be (x+py)(y+qy)
You just need to figure out what p and q are
Does that make sense?
