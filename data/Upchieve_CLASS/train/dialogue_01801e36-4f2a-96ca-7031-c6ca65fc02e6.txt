Hi
Hey
So I have an expression I have to factor
But im stumped
ok
What is the equation?
Its pretty long so here it is: 5x^2+18ax+18x+16a^2+26a-35
and you need to find out the value of x i suppose?
No i need to factor it
ok
just a sec
alright
do you have the correct answer for this question?
no
my teacher said it was factorable
thats all i know
ok its a complex equation give me few mins more please
alright sure
Yes
You there?
I have a solution for you
yes
alright
so yes its factorable
im here
what is the solution
Which grade you are in?
10th
cool
so lets start
alright then
5x^2+18ax+18x+16a^2+26a-35
This is your equation
yes
which can be written as
5x^2+18(a+1)x+16a^2+26a-35
right?
I just took 18 and x outside of the parentheses
yeah
ok
5x^2+18ax+18x+(2a+5)(8a-7)
sorry
5x^2+18(a+1)x+16a^2+26a-35
so we were here right
this can be written as
5x^2+18(a+1)x+(2a+5)(8a-7)
make sense?
yes
feel free to ask any question you may have
Now that we have a quadratic equation of the form
ax^2+bx+c
i see
where a = 5
b=18(a+1)
c=(2a+5)(8a-7)
following it?
yes
ok
and plug that in to the quadratic equation
wait no
so we have a formula to get the factors of a quadratic equation of format ax^2+bx+c
nvm carry on
alright
so the factors = [-b+ sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a
[-b sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a
[-b- sqrt(b^2-4ac)]/2a
do you know this formula?
yes
cool
so just plug the values of a, b and c
in this formula
to get the factors
I just told you the values of a, b and c
so when we do that
first factor = [-18(a+1) + sqrt ([18(a+1)^2-4*5*(2a+5)(8a-7)])]/2*5
second factor = [-18(a+1) - sqrt ([18(a+1)^2-4*5*(2a+5)(8a-7)])]/2*5
follow it?
yes
awesome
can you solve these?
yes
you want to do it now or later
or let me also solve it for you
just a sec
so that you can verify your answer
First root : (-8a+7)/5
Second root : -2a-5
yep
so the question you had
can be written as
{x - (-8a+7)/5}{x - (-2a-5)}
follow it?
yep
so that's your factorization
Any questions?
no
that was a neat solution thanks
You welcome
All the best for your studies
you too
thanks
alright then thanks for your help
ill try some other problems on my hw on my own
great .. feel free to contact us in case of any further questions
alright
so bye then
Bbye
