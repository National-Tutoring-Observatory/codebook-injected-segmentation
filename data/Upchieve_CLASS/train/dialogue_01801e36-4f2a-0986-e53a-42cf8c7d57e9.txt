hello
what would you like help with today
what are the rules to perform a rotation?
hello
like change in coordinates?
yes
so
if we have this point
and it rotates 90 degrees clockwise
the new point is
i switched the coordinates
and the second coordinate is negative, because it is in the 4th quadrant
but why?
ohh you read my mind
thats what i thought
as well
i wanted to ask you another question
may i ask you another question
thank you for bringing back my question
yes
sorry
the screen is glitching
ohh i thought you were playing me
i just want to show
if you draw a line
from both points to the origin
they make a right angle, which is 90 degrees
ohhh i see
so my next question is
yes
if the triangle drawn is rotate 90 clockwise around coordinate (0, -2)
where would it be?
so
it is a little hard to visualize this without a computer
so you can do this in terms of coordinates
is this point
(-1,1)?
no it is (-3, 1)
okay
so normally if a point is rotated 90 degrees clockwise the coordinates change from (x,y) to (y,-x) right?
ok... so where would the new rotate figure be?
well we have to change the coordinates according to the rule
but from (x,y) to (y,-x) is for rotation around the origin
so we imagine (0,-2) as the origin
so what should we do different when it is rotated around a point that is not the origin?
so if (0,-2) is the origin, the x-coordinates of the triangle don't change, but the y-coordinates should increase by 2
do you see that?
yeah
okay so now to rotate 90 degrees we just swap the x and y coordinates and make the y-coordinate negative
should it decrease being that it was -2?
you subtract -2 from the original y-coordinate
from the graph you can see that the distance from the bottom of the triangle to the x-axis was 1
but from y=-2, it's 3
yes
so the height has increased by 2
okay so now we just use the rule for rotation
ok
do you want to try changing the coordinates
no these are fine
i mean
do the rotation
remember to rotate by 90 degrees, (x,y) changes to (y,-x)
so for example point A will change from (-7,7) to (7,7)
and remember
so C' should be 3,3
yes
B' 7,3
and remember that the origin is (0,-2)
not (0,0)
B' should be (3,7)
now i m a bit lost
you told me that we should change to -x,y
so both A' and C' were fine but y is B' different
no i said it changes to (y,-x)
you swap the x and y coordinates and then make the y coordinate negative
ok
got it
okay
so A changes to (7,7)
yeah i see it now
thanks
okay
alright it was a pleasure receiving your help
have a wonderful evening
:)
actually one more question
yes
if it was rotated 180 degrees instead of 90
the coordinates change from (x,y) to (-x,-y)
because now it will be in the 4th quadrant right?
yes exactly
what happens to the rules when the figure is between one of the axis
lets say half of the triangle is over the -x axis
the same rules will apply
got it
just make sure to do each individual coordinate
i know its hard to visualize
alright
now for realz
i know it is hard
but i have to let you go
trust me, it is not you... it is me
thanks for your help
okay no problem
come back any time
sure will.
