hey
helloo
hey sorry it took me a while to write it out
its alright :)
so basically I'm taking algebra 2 and trig but the teacher I have is so confusing to learn from and I'm always confused of what to do
so here first look at the 6
okay
you multiply it by what is left after you cross out everything under it and beside it
then you do the same for the 1 and the 4
ohhhh
then you solve that
it should be -1 not +1 in the thing I wrote
there?
yes
oh okayy
I'm just gonna do the work on paper cause there's no room on here and then just write down my answer if that's okay with you
also it is probably easier to evaluate the 2by2 matrix before multiplying
because you deal with less big numbers that way
how would u evaluate the 2by2 matrix before multiplying
ohhhh
that makes a lot more sense now
and so on
do you think you can find the answer now?
yea it seems a lot easier just by looking at it
thank you soooooo much
great
no problem
anything else I can help you with?
do u know cramer's rule
yes
okay
do you have a specific example you would like me to explain it through?
or should I give you the general case?
yea there's a few practice questions we were given to study
alright
how do u get three 2's?
my bad
its okay I do it all the time
first, solve the 2by2 matrix
for a you take the 6.5,10 matrix and put it instead of the first column of the 2by2 matrix and divide it by the result of the first 2by2
for b you put it instead of the second column
does this make sense?
yea
I get it now
great :)
anything else?
that's basically it
thank you so much!!!
no problem
have a good night
ur a great person for helping ;)
you too
