Hey need help with geometry.
Hello. What is your question?
m<1=104 degrees I'm looking for the other three degrees.
2,3,4
So angle labeled by 1 is 104 degrees?
Yes
Angle 1 and 3 have the same degree. If angle 1 is 104, then angle 3 is also 104.
Ok thanks
Angle 1 + angle 2 = 180 degrees. So if angle 1 is 104, then angle 2 should be 180-104 = 76.
Angle 2 and angle 4 have the same degree. Angle 2 is 76 so angle 4 is also 76.
Ok
Thanks
No problem. Any other question?
No I'll let you know if I need anything else.
Thank you. Nice day.
