if angle EBC is a right angle, then ray BE is perpendicular to ray AC
i need to state the theorem or definintion
hello
Hi
How you doing today?
okay
what about u
I am good thanks
So your question is what is this theorm?
yes
So EBC is a right angle
yes
that is the first information which is given to us
what else is given in the question
just the picture and i already includes that
ok
do you have any options to choose from in this question?
no i do not
alright
so the definition to state here is
the sum of all the angles on the straight line is always 180 degrees
so sum of angle ABD + DBE + EBF + FBC = 180
the definition of a straight angle
yes
because AC is a straight line
also if you note ... we are given that EBC is right angle
correct
thank u
so which means ABE is also a right angle
Did I answer your question?
I still have more
sure go ahead
i am not great at naming defintions
If ray AC is perpendicular to ray BE, then ABE is a right angle
Yes it will be a right angle
so it is the defination of a right angle
Yes
That is correct
If ray BE is perpendicular to ray AC, then measurement of angle ABE is 90
Yes this is also a definition of right angle
so this one and the other one are the same
Yes
both tell us that angle ABE is 90 degrees or right angle
i think i get it
Great
If angle ABE is congruent to angle EBC, then  straight line AC is perpendicular to ray BE
is that def of a straight line
yes its a straight line
thank u
sorry if that was a time waster for u
no not at all .. glad that I helped
thank u again
bye
