hey
hey
what can i help you with?
I have a question about graphing system of inequalities, and finding the vertex
i want to know to find it without graphing
do you have a specific example?
x+y > 2
4y<x+8
y>2x-5
ok so first you want to have y in all of your equations on one side alone
so x+y > 2
becomes y>2-x
and 4y<x+8
yeah i did that for all
ok great
now you take one equation
and set the y in it from another equation
and solve for x
oh ok
you do it between the 1st equation and 2nd then 1st and 3rd then the 2nd and 3rd
ok i get how to do it now
thank you
great :)
no problem
anything else?
no that was it
but thank you again
