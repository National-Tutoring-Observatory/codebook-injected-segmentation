Hello
Hi
the question that I need help is this : A area of a parking lot is 600 square meters. A car requires 6 square meters and a bus requires 30 meters of space. The lot can handle a maximum of 60 vehicles.
part a) let c represent the numbers of cars and b represent the numbers of buses. Write a system of inequalities to represent the number of vehicles that can be parked.
part b) if a car costs $3 and a bus costs $8 to park in a lot, determine the number of each vehicle to maximum to the amount collected
this is the problem I need help with
Alright
so for part a
each car requires 6 meters squared so 6c and each bus requires 30 so 30b and the size of the parking lot is 600 so 6c+30b<=600
and
since we only can have 60 vehicles then c+b=<60
Does that make sense?
yeah
So now for part b you have to solve for b and c first
and you multiply what you get by the prices
do you want me to walk you through that?
yeah
alright
so you first c+b=60 becomes b=60-c
then you plug in this 60-c into 6c+30b=600 and solve for c
60-c is plugged in the b’s place
does that make sense?
yeah it makes sense
so do you think you can find the solution for part b now?
for part b it says to find the maximum, does that mean i have to find the highest amount of cars and buses or?
oh wait nevermind
also can you help find the solution
yeah of course
i got c=50 and b=10
ok so now you multiply 50 by the price for cars and 10 by the price for buses
also
you have to check when you have 0 cars and 20 buses
and
when you have 60 cars and 0 buses
so wait what would the final answer come out to be
so we have these cs and bs 60,0 and 50,10 and 0,30
60*3+0*8=180
50*3+10*8=230
0*3+30*8=240
so the maximum amount you get us when you have 0 cars and 30 buses
is*
oh ok
Does everything make sense?
yeah it all makes sense, thank you and that was it
No problem
