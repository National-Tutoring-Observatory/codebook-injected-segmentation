hey im doing geometry and need help
Hi!
How can I help you?
with this
finding the missing side length
Okay!
Interesting
Just to confirm
That is 16 right?
yes
there all ft
Okay awesome
So how would you start this problem?
Or where do you think you might start?
i dont no
ik that all sides have the same as that nmber
number
Okay!
So there is a start
So when you look at problems like these, you realize that they typically give you hints on how to solve the missing side
With the other sides
ok
So there is that "?" side
16?
But you have also have the 16 side
If this was a square or rectangle, you would just think that both sides are equal
but it isn't
At least not yet!
4?
What you can do is draw an imaginary lne and make it a square
so i would cut it to make two rectangles
There are many ways to do this
The way I would do it is the following
Draw an imaginary line to make this a big rectangle
