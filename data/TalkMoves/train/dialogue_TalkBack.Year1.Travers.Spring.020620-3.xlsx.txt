Why is that videotaping me
Why is that thing videotaping me
Its videotaping me
Wait what
I thought you said itll go around like on the carpet
No it just goes like this
It just swivels like this
I dont see it doing that
Its probably because Im mostly standing over here
Ladies and gentlemen when I say high five what I mean is youre turning youre looking and youre putting one hand up and I can see your eyes
We are back at zero places Okay
Thank you hands down
Ms Miller told me that you started this lesson on angles yesterday so tell me about We always name our angles with a letter at the vertex so we will call this angle A and we will call this angle B
Want you to think back to yesterday what did you discover about angle A and angle B
Ill have you think for a minute
What could you tell me about angle A and angle B okay
I want you to look at your face partner at your group
Say good morning
Good morning
Do you have one over here excellent
How about that
With your current face partner
Please talk about what did you discover about angle A and angle B go
Does that mean angle A is smaller
Its so good were reviewing this isnt it
I want to revise my thinking
Excellent
What do you want to revise your thinking about
Well I said
Right now I just feel like the lines
Okay all right
All right my friends high five
I love how three groups remembered
Lets try it again
Ready
Ready
High five
Thank you friends
Eyes back up here
I heard some great conversations but I also heard some great questions
When I draw your stick would you share something you just talked about with your partner and well see if we can clarify our thinking
Were talking about what did we discover about angle A and angle B okay
Whos lucky number 25
All right
Can you remind me your name
Brady
Brady I knew that
Will you stand up and tell us something you heard with you and your partner
My partner said that she thinks that theyre both the same
Tell me what you mean by the same
They both are the same angle
Although ones smaller but theyre still the same and like the same length with the angle
Theyre both pointed at the same The degree of that
The degree
Im hearing you say theyre the same in degrees okay
Thank you for sharing Brady
All right well hear from a couple more
My friends I want you to come back to our sentence starters up here with I agree I disagree
Think about what Brady just said
Whos lucky number 22
Thats me
Fern would you tell us think about what Brady just said and you may add on
I agree with him because if you like drew  the angles are the same but not the size
It kind of depends on
Okay do you guys hear what Ferns saying
It depends
Ms Miller asked you a question yesterday which angle is bigger so it depends what she means by that
Tell us more about that Fern
You can go point to it
The size is bigger but not the angle
The size of what is bigger
We would call that a Do we know the math vocabulary for that
Ray
Ray
Heres the vertex
Im hearing Fern say the rays are bigger in angle B
The rays are smaller in angle A but what about the angle measurement
Theyre the same
How do you know
Because  traced them
I put angle A and angle B and they were the same
They were the same
Lets have one more
Damian would you add on to that
Would you share something that
I agree with
Do you mind standing up so we can really hear you
Thank you honey
Tell your class
I agree with Brady and Fern because theyre both the same size but ones just smaller and ones bigger
Like Brady said the degree matters too
I just draw that right here like Ms Miller told us and I put it against the bigger one
They go the same way and of the same size but theyre not ones smaller and ones bigger
What Im hearing you say is when we talk about angles being bigger and smaller were not talking about the length of the ray
What were talking about is the measurement where the Did you name this yesterday
You guys know what this little arrows called
Vertex
Its called an arc okay
So you look at where the arc is and thats where you measure the size of the angle later
You measure the size of the angle by the arc
Ms Miller they have some amazing conversations about the size of the angle
Yes
Would you like to add on
I said that on the screen he said that he thought angle B was bigger
We were supposed to write what we want like if we disagree or agree with her
Do you think angle B is bigger
No
Well I said I agree because the size of B is bigger but I disagree because the angle is the same size and the same type of angle
You guys have some really great thinking about that
Do you want to add one more thing Michael
Yes so at first I agreed with Fern and Brady and Damian said but now Im  because now I remember that the arrows meaning it goes on forever
When were talking about angles what we really want to pay attention to is the arc the measurement of whats inside the angle
Though the rays might be really long or really short when were talking about the size of an angle thats not what were paying attention to
Add on to it Colin
One of the rays has an arrow on it
It makes it a ray
Go point to it
Yes so everybody knows what youre talking about honey
Yes
The arrow right here usually goes out throughout and it doesnt stop
Thank you for clarifying that
Its on both sides so technically theyre the same length
Probably well youre right
If B stayed and then A grew it would be the same size as B
Yes
They sure did
My friends lets look at the bottom
Im going to come back to that Colin
I would like for us to look at this bottom part of our math message
Can you turn yours over so I can see what youre looking at right now
Thank you Brendan
So this bottom part of our math message its asking us to look at wedges
Were going to talk about what a wedge is
It just means a piece
Were going to use our faction circle pieces
Ms Miller where do we keep those in here
Okay ladies and gentlemen would you please take out your light green fraction circles
How many of them
Well I dont know because you need to figure out this is the question
What does it say
Okay lets start Instead of green my friends I think youll need green later
Lets start with purple right now
Purple wedges
Light purple or dark
Okay
Lets try it
Try them
How many whole wedges fit into the angle
Try it out lets see what we find
Joshwell do you have your fraction circles
No theres
Why not
Can you look for me please
Or if you dont have it what would be an option for you of where to look or what to do
Probably at the back desk
Does Ms Miller have extras
I dont have extras but we have some friends that are absent
Im just thinking he needs to be responsible for what he could do right now to participate with everyone else
I did have a friend that was like going to share it with somebody next to them that would be a good idea
That would be a great strategy wouldnt it
How else does a cube look
We dont know
Try them out
Ill go with the light purple
Try it out
Its light purple
Ms Travers she said what if its not an even amount
I think on the first one it wants to know how many whole wedges would fit into the angle
Do you think that they mean maybe not necessarily a certain color
Do you think they mean like it doesnt have to be purple it could be is there another color thats a whole
I think both wedges are
What I think we are looking at right now is try out some different wedges and lets see how many whole wedges can fit into this angle
This angle is called angle CDE
I want you to try to fit some wedges into the angle and have it fit perfectly
Cant this angle also be called EDC
It could be
It could be
When
I have this one and that one
I have two of them
Try it
try it out a different way
Yes now you can probably use that  to help you with the next one
Okay now I have three
The kids are
Why arent all of our measurements the same
They used different size wedges
Do other wedges create  measurement
I have four
What do you think that one does
You can measure amount of rotation by measuring the spread of the angle
Theres lots of
Later one way we will measure is
No its whatever quarters fit on here so you have to figure out what fits four on here
Fourth graders my friends Im looking for what wedges are being used to fill the angle and Im actually going to have you stand up push in your chair and stand up behind your chair
Everybody stand up
Everybody push in their chair
What Im looking for right now is youre going to do another gallery walk and in our gallery walk were going to go around and look at what fraction circles or what wedges did our classmates try when they were measuring this angle with wedges
Okay
So should you touch anyone elses work when you walk by
No
No
Should you look at other peoples work when you walk by
Yes
Right where Ms Miller is standing everybody point to the front whiteboard
I want you to think while youre walking around do you agree do you disagree did you think something similar to this partner this classmate did you use a similar strategy a different strategy
Ready
Ready
You have a 30second walk Im going to ring the bell
When the bell rings rather when it stops head back to your seat
Please head back to your seat
Now please come to the carpet facing the screen
Sorry David
Thank you
Theyve accepted it
Kind of
All right ladies and gentlemen thank you for coming to the carpet so quietly and showing us that youre ready
Id like you to take a look here at this mathematical representation how many wedges fit into this angle
Please show me with your fingers
How many blue wedges fit
Two okay
Youre just listening right now okay
How many wedges fit into this angle
Show me with your fingers
I dont see everyones hands I need to see a couple more
Whats our answer now
Three
Okay
All right
How many wedges fit into this angle
My question for you right now is which one is right
High five someone next to you so you have a thinking partner
Show me who youre talking to
Would you please sit up straight Brady and I want you to think about what the three we just showed is there one thats right
Talk to your partner
Go
Go
Well it took me a minute too
Okay close your conversations please
Thank you for your smart thinking
Would you keep your hand up if youre willing to share your thinking right now
Brendan
I think they all are because I tried all of those too when I was trying to figure out how many would fit on the second one but then I realized when we came to the carpet that all of these could be whole wedges so I figured that the orange one was one whole because at first I thought just the whole circle like the red one would be the whole because I thought that on the second one it would be four so I thought it would be the yellow one but then I saw Alyssas when she put 13 on hers and then I revised my thinking and thinking that that was one whole because it fit perfectly on there
Thank you for explaining why you revised your thinking and how your thinking keeps changing because thats a good thing in math
Colin would you like to add on
I was thinking
Its Jack
No Colin
Colin
Okay
All right tell us your thinking
Tell your classmates
I respectfully disagree with Brendan because if you look on the other questions it says that how would you put the fourth wedge
You cant put four wedges on there because that would be
Yes you can
Yes you can
My friends what I want us to think about is we start
Okay but you cant do all of them
I just love how your brains are thinking so much about this
I respectfully disagree
My friends its not okay to just shout out because thats not respectfully communicating with your partners
Heres what I want you to know youre all right
This was one way of being right this is another way of being right
Lets look at this on right now
Excuse me
Just a minute please honey
How much of the fourth wedge
I think were supposed to have the light purple
I think light purple is
Do they mean this one
No I think they mean light purple
About how much of the fourth wedge is inside the angle
Thatd be because you can fit 412
Yes you can fit 412
We could fit 412
I think thats what the fourth wedge
How did you know we could fit 412
Who said that
Yes Alyssa
Before I counted out I knew that four times three equals 12 but so then I counted out and it worked out
You know what I think
Tell us more
Tell us more
Heres what I think its really asking when it comes down to it
What does it mean to measure an angle
When we measure something we need to use a standard unit
That means we have to use something like an inch a centimeter a mile a kilometer or a wedge a colored wedge
When we measure something we need to use a standard unit so when were talking about measuring an angle what were really talking about is measuring the distance between this ray and this ray
Now we could go on a walk raise your hand if you go on walks with your family
I might go for a walk and I might measure my walk in steps
I might say Yes I got 10000 steps today
Ms Miller might go on the same walk and she might say Well I got two miles
Paris might go on the same walk and she said
Well I got 28 kilometers
Who would be right
All of them
All of us
Well actually we dont know
Why
You have different sized feet
Because the unit of measurement I used was different than the unit of measurement Ms Miller used was different than the unit of measurement that Paris used
What were talking about is we all walked the same distance
Lets say Paris walked from C to ETwalked from C to E and Ms Miller walked from C to E
unit so youll get different answers because you guys have different sized feet
Yes why did we get different answers
Because you used feet she used miles and Paris used kilometers
Exactly okay
We all walked the same distance
Paris and Ms Miller and I we all walked the same distance but I used steps Paris used kilometers and Ms Miller measured hers in miles
We all walked the same distance but it was measured in a different way
Thats the same thing with this angle
You were each measuring it with a different fraction piece or wedge but the angle is the same distance
The angle is the same measurement we were just using different pieces
Does anyone have any questions or comments about this
Yes my dear
Are we supposed to
We are
I dont agree because I measured them
You know a way to measure angles
Yes
Does anyone else
Brendan whos over there with you because I cant see your handsome faces
Cayden and Damian when Im teaching I need to see your handsome faces
You know a way to measure angles
Yes
Tell us more
Tell us more
Okay I usually use a box and a circle to tell  because equals are very similar to fraction pieces because they can do the outline
They sure are theyre similar to fraction pieces
I was measuring it with one of the 112 pieces  Id do
I was thinking it might be a fortyfive degree angle
Youre starting to think about degrees of angles and that you know that different fraction pieces are different measures
Yes
Were going to get back to that thats smart thinking
I want to tell you another way to measure angles
My friends another way to measure angles is with the tool called the protractor
Youre going to get to that in a couple of days but the way were going to talk about measuring angles today is with rotations
Everybody say rotation
Rotation
Im going to give you a challenge right now
You are going to need to go collect all your fraction pieces and put them back in the baggie
Im going to have you keep this paper on your desk but we dont need it any more right now
Heres what I need your desk clean and clear except for this paper
Your fraction circle pieces are going to be back in the baggie and you are going to stand behind your desk like a pencil like this when youre ready and go
Can you show me help me please while I get these papers back with their owners
I borrowed yours
Damian I borrowed yours and
Will you keep that idea oftheres 360 degrees in a circle right now in your brain and be ready to share that in a minute
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for showing me your pencil and that youre ready
Pencil standing straight up and tall
I love how Mark is ready
I love how Michael is ready
Im waiting for a couple of friends back here to show me that they are ready
I would like nothing in your hands
I would like you to face me and I would like you to face it so that you can see the screen right here
Ms Miller you are doing an excellent job
My friends today we will explore the word of say it
Rotation
Were going to use rotation the word rotation to help us with measuring angles and were going to use this word iteration of measurement units and angle measures
That means were going to keep trying different ways to use rotation to measure angles
We will know that we have it when we practice different kinds of turns because turn is another word for what
Rotation
Youre going to be doing what
Turn
And
Rotations
Were going to be using those to measure benchmark angles
Now heres what I mean by benchmark
Benchmark means angles that we use a lot
How many degrees Colin this is where I need you how many degrees are in a circle
360
360
Are you facing me right now
Yes
We are going to turn clockwise
Ready put your right hand up
We are going to be turning clockwise were going to rotate 360 degrees or a full circle ready
Go
Go
She didnt say two circles
That was one circle
She said one
We rotated a full turn
Hands down
Left hand up
We are going to rotate one full turn counterclockwise
That means the opposite way of the clock
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Now if I was measuring that angle that was a full turn angle or Colin how many degrees
360
360
Face back upfront again
We are turning clockwise which hand goes up
Right
Right
This time we are turning onehalf turn right
We are turning onehalf turn and we will be facing the back wall when were done
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Half turn
Lets see if I can stump you here
Hand down
Hold up your left hand
Were going to turn left which is counterclockwise another half turn
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Oh my God its so hard
Where should you be facing
That way
The front
Excellent
My friends so far we have turned a whole turn we have turned a halfturn and now we are going to turn a
Quarter
Quarter
How did you guess
Because we aint dumb
Because a quarter is half of
Who said that
A quarter Eva was that you
Yes
Say it again
A quarter is half of a half
A quarter is half of the half
90 degrees
Ready
Ready
Or
90 degrees
Because 90 is 14 of 360
Youre just brilliant youre blowing my mind
Ready
Ready
Face forward
Right hand
Were turning clockwise onequarter of a turn
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Keep your right hand up
Turn another onequarter of a turn
Keep your right hand up were turning clockwise another one quarter and another one quarter clockwise
Where should you be facing
The whiteboard
Okay
Left hand up
Please turn onequarter of a turn counterclockwise
Another quarter
Another quarter and another quarter counterclockwise and were facing
The whiteboard
Great
How many quarters were in a full turn
How many quarter turns were in a full turn
Four
Four okay
All right
My friends have a seat
Finally
Good thinking good practicing
Ladies and gentlemen would you please open up your math journal to page 178
178
Okay my friends
When we look at page 178 we are going to be talking about measuring angles with turns with rotations okay
Im going to do a couple with you you are going to do a couple with your thinking partner
If I can find a pencil on Ms Millers desk
Heres one right here
Woah I just lost the lead down there for you
Sorry
Its okay thats fine
Okay my friends
This is my other favorite thing to show me youre ready
Hold your pencil between two fingers like this and do it a little wiggle
Show me a good wiggle
Show me youre ready with a good wiggle
Okay pencil in your hand
Point your eraser to the word describe
Ready
Ready
I want to hear all of your voices
Go
Go
Describe each angle by the amount of rotations
Use the words full turn threequarters turn halfturn and quarterturn
Describe each angle by the amount of rotations
Use the words full turn 34 turn half turn and quarter turn
My friends these are your answers
Number one the amount of the rotation
So were talking about from here the amount of rotation
Would you please whisper what you think the answer is to your face partner
Go
Go
Quarter turn
Half turn
Okay three two one
Say it out loud
Half turn
Quarter
I love when I hear two different answers
This is a teachers dream
Okay high five
I heard two answers
I heard quarterturn I heard halfturn
May I have a volunteer defend your thinking for one of those answers
Quarter turn or half turn
Brady
Nice love
Would you stand up for us so we can hear you
I thought it was a quarter turn based on the rotation of how far the angle was and the reason why I think it is a quarter turn is because if you look it looks like its not a full half turn based on how long it is
Thank you Brady
Would you call on someone else
My friends remember our sentence starters on the whiteboard
Alyssa
I think its a halfturn because if you look at the shape of it if you do that shape again I think its a whole square and I think that would be a whole
Alyssa would you please call on another person
Were going to keep hearing from each other
I think its a quarter turn because it mostly depends on the turn like how much you have to turn
Okay
Everybody stand up
Face the front board
Were actually going to do were starting here and were going to turn to where this ray is pointing
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
What did we just do
Quarter turn
There we go
Write it down
Our answer for number one is what
Quarter turn
Quarter turn
Lets do number two together
This is an interesting one
What do we think about look at the arc and whisper to your face partner again
Full turn quarter turn half turn threequarters turn
Whisper to your face partner again
Go
Go
Okay
Say your answer out loud
Full turn
Is there a volunteer to explain their thinking
Who havent I heard from in a while
Bryce
I said it was a whole turn because if you look at the very bottom of it it shows a whole circle
What did that tell you
It told me that it was rotating all the way around
Thank you for sharing Bryce
Vincent you would rotate it all the way around
Could everybody turn and look at Bryce
Will you show us by actually turning your body
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
He did a full turn
Its like that earth thing you were doing isnt it
Thats right
Heres your job
Stand up find your thinking partner
Same thinking partner
Same thinking partner as before
You and your thinking partner are going to solve numbers three four five and six
Freeze please
Will you show me a quick frozen
When youre with your thinking partner youre going to talk through numbers three four five and six
When you are done go back to your seat because thats Ms Hilgreth Hildriths clue that everybody is done ready to check
Okay
the ones that we
You are going to find your thinking partner that you are matched up with on the front whiteboard and do numbers three four five and six
Go
Go
Because if this was ones the quarter and it went like that
Im going to come back later and get
Im going to come back later and get these All my stuff
Because I have Masterson next I dont want to be too late
