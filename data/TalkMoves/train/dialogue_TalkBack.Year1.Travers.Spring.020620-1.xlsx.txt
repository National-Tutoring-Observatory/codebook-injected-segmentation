All right
njuu
Good morning
One of my favorite things to do is to come and to teach 4th grade and 5th grade
Thank you for having again
Ms Martha said you re working on your warmup your mental math right now
I don t want to hear any answers
Here s what I want to hear
Does anyone have a strategy for how they re solving
For example how many minutes are in seven hours
What strategy are you using to help you solve how many ounces are in 30 pounds
What is your strategy without sharing an answer
Yes
Michael would you start us please
You
I don t want an answer
I want you to tell me your strategy
Choose one and tell me your strategy
For seven hours I know five minutes is 300 seconds
I know that two minutes is 120 seconds
5  2  7 hours
300  120  420
Sorry
A number
Equals a number
Pretend I never said that
Okay
Michael I m hearing you say you were thinking about how many seconds were in minute how many minutes were in hour
Then were you using addition subtraction multiplication
I was using addition
All right
Anybody else willing to share
Bryce
I sometimes find the answers by I think about it with if its like  is always like how many minutes are in five hours
How many minutes That s a good one because how many minutes are in five hours is not up there
How would you solve how many minutes are in five hours
I would do 6 x 5
Where did you get six from
From the 60 minutes
Then I would add the 0 to get my answer
You would attach the zero because were not adding the 0
We re attaching the 0
You would do 6 x 5 is
300
30 attach the zero and you get
300
300 minutes
Okay
Good
Gage
So how many minutes are in seven hours
I doubled 4 which equals 8 and then I take away 1 to get my answer
Are you saying once you get this answer you can double it to get this answer
Yes
Then with seven hours you do 4  4  8 and then take away 1 7 and get how many minutes are in seven hours
I love hearing these different strategies
Thank you for sharing
All right
My friends would you please erase your whiteboards
From now you may put your whiteboard and marker right back in your desk
What you need right now is a sharp pencil ruler and scissors
Can I borrow one
I m sure he s in a different place right now
All right
Ladies and gentlemen you re going to show me youre ready by having pencil ruler this paper
Everything else can be pushed to side please
When you have pencil ruler and paper please come to the carpet and face the screen
Don t bring anything
You re leaving those materials on your desk please
Do you have any extra copies
I think we re good because you get three
Okay
Thank you
My friends it sounds like with Ms Martha you already went over the learning objective for today
What I would like to do is just talk a little bit about some of those words that are up there so that we re ready for today s learning
All right
One thing that we re doing today is we re looking at figures that have symmetry or figures that are symmetric
Will you please say the word symmetry
Symmetry
Say the word symmetric
Symmetric
Do you notice some part of the word that s the same
Okay
Violet what do you notice
The first part are the same
This part
Yes
They are not all the same
What does that tell about a word if most of the word is the same
What does that tell us
What do you think
It means the same or very similar
I want you to think right now in your head what do you know about this word symmetry or this word symmetric
I m going to have you put your hands down
I want you to turn and face a partner
I want to see who you ll be talking with
You will be turning your body
Having a team of three is okay also
Show me right now with a high five who will you be talking to
Jesse would you join Michael so you guys have a team of three please
Joel are you in a team
You have a partnership
All right
My friends what do you know about these two words
Symmetry or symmetric
Talk to this partner and then I m going to do some sharing out
Ready
Go
Go
Commercial break
That means pause
If you see I know I may have confused you about talking about word parts
I want you to think about math right now
Think about geometry
Think about figures
What does it mean if a shape has symmetry or a figure is symmetric
That s what I want you talking about
Go
Go
Okay
High five
Show your partners so the people around you know it s time to get to zero voices
Thank you
Hands on your lap
I m going to call a number
I want you to respond with I think or I wonder
Because even if you re not 100 sure good math students always ask questions
You could say I wonder
Okay
25
You can start with either one of these phrases
I think it means equal
I think it means it equal
Thank you for starting our conversation
It s Brady right
Thank you Brady
Number 21
Remember you can say I think or I wonder
Who s 21
Great
Mark
I think that if you put a line in the middle of a circle then it s the same on each side
I heard Mark say I think if you put a line down the middle of the circle its the same on each side
You think that s what one of these words means or both
Okay
Thank you for starting that
Thank you for adding to the conversation Mark
All right
Raise your hand if you re number eight please
I m going to keep going
I want to remind you about when someone in our class is speaking our voices are off
Who s number six
Michael are you willing to share
I think or I wonder
I think so
I think symmetry means how similar is in both sides and symmetric means identical on both sides
I keep hearing kids talk about both sides
Both sides of what
Of a shape
Thank you
26
I think symmetry means almost the same
Symmetric means the same
We re going to do one more
You can add on
You can change
My friends who s number 10
She s not here
I ll keep going
Number four
Jesse thank you
I think that symmetry it means it s the state of it and then like that
Symmetric means it is equal on both sides
Instead of symmetric you could say it s equal on both sides
It s like it has the same length on both sides
I m hearing you say I keep hearing kids talk about if there s a line down the middle theyre same on both sides
I want to hear I want to see your thumbs
Thumb up I think I agree with that
Thumb in the middle I m not sure
Thumb down I don t agree
I keep hearing kids say if there was a line down the middle a figure is symmetric if it is the same on both sides
Show me with your thumbs way up high right now
Great
Please put your hands down and on your lap
Do we have any volunteers that would like to add to the thinking right now
Will you tell your class please
I think with the word I think they all meant the same thing but they re just their own writing
What about if I told you reflection is connected to these two words
Reflection is really important if a figure is symmetric
Talk high five same face partner
Same face partner that you had
How might a reflection be connected to symmetry and symmetric
Keep thinking about when there is a figure and two both sides of the figure are the same
Talk to your partner
Go
Go
How does reflection connect to these two words
I agree with you
Close your conversations in three two one and zero voice
Right now my friends you re going to show me you re ready by sitting in your spot facing the screen
Turn your bodies
Show me your listening body with our back up straight our shoulders are back and our hands on our lap or right next to us please
All right
We re going to add to our conversation now about that word reflection
Number 18 how does the word reflection connect
It connects because you look in the mirror and you see yourself
I don t if that s symmetric
You are doing a great job getting us started
Reflection made you think of the word mirror
Good
Was your hand up first Gage
We were talking about the same thing me and Damian how you mostly see reflection in a mirror or something
We were talking about with the symmetry and symmetric about like how can we explain it and they re the same thing
That s like with a mirror
When you look in it it s like your face and then you see the exact same face on the other side
It s also like when you re with a piece of water you look at it and then it reflects back at you
Do you see the same thing
Sometimes
Not exactly
What do you mean by not exactly
Because there s like writing or something on it
Or if its dirty
If there s writing it might be backwards or flipped
Yes
Grant did you want to add on to that
Yes
I was thinking about addon
Tell us more
Tell us more
That line we were talking about that s probably the real and it
That line represents the mirror and it shows you where the other side is the reflection
My friends what if I showed you this
What if I showed you this
We have some words on the back of that
This is what you have at your desk right now
We re going to be using this and you read some of you guys were brilliant
We re going to be making a mirror image of this side of the figure
If we make the mirror image of this side of the figure watch my hand
I want you to notice what my hand does right now
What did I just do with my hand
In one word what did I just do
Everybody say one word
Go
Go
Flip
Flip
All of these words
Symmetry Watch my finger
This is what we call a line of symmetry
This is where your mirror would go and it would flip the image
This side is the reflection
That s what we re going to be doing today
It s going to be a really cool lesson
If we go back to what our learning target is
Let s read it together again
Ready
Sitting up straight
Listening body
Ready
Go
Go
We will review symmetry and explore properties of symmetric figures
I got it when I can discuss properties of symmetric figures and complete symmetric figures creating reflections
My friends so properties when I think about that word in math it s just ways to describe things in math
We re going to be doing a lot of figures that have symmetry describing them using math language
Stand up
Stretch
Raise your hands up as high as you can
Don t run into things
Do you really
Now reach to the right
Reach to the left
On the way back to your seat I want you to do lunges
Ready set go
Lunges
Ladies and gentlemen I forgot I had one more thing to show you
All right
Show me you re ready by facing the screen
I would like your eyes on the screen
I want you to read this red word right here
What s this red word
Symmetry
Symmetry
A figure has line symmetry
I need your eyes up here please
If a line can be Watch my hands
Drawn through it
Everybody rulers on your desk pencils on your desk
Put your hand up
Line of symmetry
Say it
Line of symmetry
If a figure has symmetry if a line can be drawn through it so that it is divided into two parts
Put your hands up
Two hands
Thumbs touching just barely
Line of symmetry and the two parts are mirror images of each other
Put your hands together like this
The two parts look alike but they face opposite directions
More generally a figure has symmetry if parts of it look alike but they re in different positions
All right
Hands down
Let s do some practice
Are we ready
I do want to tell you something that s important to me
Colin
A couple of things that are important to me when I m teaching is that respectful listening and being respectful to the people around you is making sure your voice is off so that everybody around you has an equal Colin to learn
T weve talked a little bit too about like in forced control and selfcontrol
If I have something that pops into my mind I don t just let it come out from my mouth right
Well there s a reason why
Because it might shutdown the thinking of all the kids around you
If you pop something out of your mouth then the other kids don t have the same opportunity to think about it
Another thing that s important to me is that we re using materials correctly
Do we need scissors in our hand right now
No
No but we will in a little while
Do we need rulers in our hands right now
No
Do we ever need to spin rulers in school
No
I don t want to see that
Al right
Ms Martha would you mind getting me a ruler
Sure
All right
What would happen if we folded this right here
Tell your shoulder partner at your team right now what would happen if we folded this
What would we see
You guys have some great predictions
Our goal right now is to first start thinking about before you fold it what figure do you think is
What shape do you think this is
I want to hear one word from all of your mouths right now
One two three go
Kite
Kite
I heard kite
You are correct
How did you know
Anna
If
Wait
Where should our eyes be when Anna s speaking
On Anna
Perfect
Thank you
If you fold back one side then it looks like half of the kite with the beginning of a string at the bottom
If you fold it both halves would match correct
All right
I would like you to fold
Actually sorry
Freeze
First thing we re going to do is you use a straightedge to draw line segments connecting the dots in order
That means we re using a straightedge to connect A to B B to C C to D like this
I m going to start at A and use my straightedge to connect A to B
Then I m very carefully going to match up B to C and draw it
You re going to continue all the way down until you have J would be last connection that you will make
Please use a straightedge so that your figure will be symmetric
Ms Martha is happy to come around if someone is stuck or needs help or is confused
Make sure you have to use that ruler because if you dont use that ruler remember T said that it won t be
It won t match up perfectly
You will not be showing symmetry in your figure when it s flipped
We need perfectly straight line segments
Ladies and gentlemen when you have this you re going to show me by doing this
This is just what for me what I do
Tand correct me if you think I m wrong which I am sure youll do
But its easier if I have a lot of good clean station on my desk and you draw straight lines on top of my journal in my book in anything else it s not going to work as well
It s part of being organized
Yes
Its part of being organized
You should have a clean place to work on your desk
I can tell Elijah is ready
It looks like Seans almost ready
Alex is ready
Cole is ready
Cole is ready
Mark is ready
Molly is ready
Okay
All right
Okay
Rulers down and pencils down
Please pick up your scissors
The very first thing we re going to is fold along the dotted line
You are going to keep it folded and cut on the solid line
Do you cut on the dotted line
No
No
You only cut on the solid line
Number one fold
Number two cut on the solid black outside line
We re going to careful fold
My friends you re going to very carefully fold
You re going to make sure that your fold is right on that line
Then my friends when I cut I m going to put it on my desk like this and very very carefully right on those lines
This means we have to be very careful with our scissors
I m actually going to do this
Were you supposed to cut on the dotted line
Were supposed to cut all of them
Because he didnt know he was  exactly
He had to go to the office
How do you cut on this
Ms Martha how do I cut on this line
Oh I did it
4th graders when you re ready these are the three things you will still need on your desk
Ruler folded kite pencil
You re going to take all those little pieces you just cut
You re going to stand up and please walk them over to recycle
Then that gets everyone up out of their seats
If you re done cutting the only things I want to see on your desk are ruler kite pencil and your recycling scraps
Okay ruler kite pencil recycling scraps
You may put your scissors away
What about the
You don t need it right now
Ruler kite pencil
This might be a fabulous time for dojo points because I see a lot of kids that follow the directions exactly like Mariah follows the directions exactly actually all team points this team is looking awesome
Okay do we have all the scraps
Scraps in the recycler
Ill throw away your scraps
Scissors put away
Also when youre  actually get done
All right
You aren t even ready
Here is the best part of todays lesson
Everyone back in their seats in five four three two and one
We re going to make the pattern on our kite symmetric
We re going to make the pattern symmetric please open your kite
How are we going to make our pattern symmetric
What that means is we want this watch my hand on the screen ready
We want this pattern to flip
Anyone have any ideas how are we going to get this pattern to be symmetric or exactly flip onto the other side
London I haven t heard from you today
Smart thinking
Since we don t have mirrors what we re actually going to do we re going to be holding our paper up we re going to have our pencil in our hand
My friends I need everybody to really watch me right now this is going to be different than we ve done in math on other days ready
You re going to be looking through to the other side and wherever you see a vortex or a point on this side you re going to make it you have to look through with the light
I m just doing the points so I m going to show you
My finger is getting in the way of this
How do you draw on it
Look what T did
This is what mine looks like
She just carefully drew a point
So I looked up here and it s helpful if you have it in the light and you hold the paper together squeeze it together and wherever you see a letter and a vortex or a point draw then with your pencil and you will need
I literally only seen one
I found two
It was hopeful for me to look for the letters and we re looking for letters A through J
If you push down you can like
Right if you squeeze the sides of paper together you can see
Even if you re not even shining it in the light and you push them together you can
This is harder
Okay I m going to come around so you see mine is yours similar
Francis yours its similar
Yes
Don t worry about the letters put in the dots
Start with the dots
You can also use a flashlight
Put some point see like in this just the point
I would have raised yes you re going to want to erase and just put the points in
Kenan hold it up so you can see the light
Oh you know what it s okay Ill
Squeeze it see there is one
Ms Martha
There is one see what Im doing
There is one
I think you have a couple up here I want you to do
Tell me about your different idea
Some part cutting and corner hauling
All right next step
When I get to zero I would like all of your kites pencils and rulers just like this on your desk
Im not done yet
Five four
Oh I love these good listeners three two one zero
Please put your kite on your desk if you re not quite done you will get caught up in a minute
Okay I want everyone to watch me do the next step
I m waiting until pencils are on the desks
Yes just to let you know group two just got another point
Good job group two
All their pencils were down and three points were exactly like that
Remember sometimes I might teach exactly like Ms Martha sometimes I do things a little differently
What I m waiting for right now is everyone to have their pencil on their desk
If your neighbor has a pencil on their hands would you say Please put your pencil down
Please put your pencil down
Thank you okay
Now I would like your eyes on the screen so you can see the next step
My friends how are we going to make this side symmetrical or symmetric to this side
Well if I know from point A to B over here we have a line segment then what do I need from A to this point over here
I need a line segment
To have the pattern be the same on both sides I m going to use ruler Oh your pencils are still down thank you friends
We need T like 10 minutes point for waiting
Okay we re going to connect the dots on this whole blank side and when you re done you should see a mirror image
Say mirror image
Mirror image
We have from A to B
Now I have to think to myself B to C Now I m going to go B to C Im always going to look at what happened on the right side of my kite and does this line match or reflect this line
Now I have from C to D and I m going to make this line segment from C to D You may now start yours
No you re not going to worry about the letters you re just going to draw on the line segments good question
Yes don t worry about that
You are exactly right and  mirror image
You are
Yes this is an interesting thing for us
Oh my its a sword
Okay
Mine turned out weird
What happened here
If you re finding that yours is not a mirror image is not a perfect reflection then you made a mistake somewhere in your line segments
I want you to go back
Try to find where you made the mistake
What is that
What s what
Oh yesterday
I had really stressed
Friends Brendan he just accidentally missed the G dot
Hes just turning it over and filling that in
Also T a little bit
If it wasnt folded perfectly on the line of symmetry it might be a little off too
I dont know what I did wrong
Correctly
I would like you to think about something while you re finishing
How are each side similar
How is each side similar
How is each side different
Ms Martha I don t know
You know what
Fold it if you need to fold it and look under the light again to see Wait
Maybe I missed a spot or I put that one in the wrong spot
What does each side have that is alike
They are the same in what ways
Brendan
Theyre both facing the lines
The ones that are going out are facing their direction but one is facing right and one is facing left
What I m hearing you say is could we say they are the same shape but facing the different direction
Yes
Good
How else is each side alike
Does each side of the shape have the same number of line segments
Yes
Think about that
Does each side have the same number of line segments
Does each side have the same number of vertices or vertex points
Yes
How is each side different
Anna
One doesn t have letters on it
One does not have letters
If it did have letters what would those letters look like
Someone asked that question right
They would be backwards
They would be the reflection or backwards letter
They never look like theyre sure and it has writing on it
When you look in the mirror
It has an S at the end
S is backwards but it is still at the beginning
I want to show you one more really cool thing about a line of symmetry
Everybody say Line of symmetry
Line of symmetry
Put your finger on your line of symmetry
The line of symmetry shows us where the reflection is
It shows us where we make the mirror image
Here s the last really cool thing I want to show you about symmetry
Everybody point to point B
Point to B I want you The one that actually has the B I want you to get your ruler and I want you to measure the distance from B to the line of symmetry
Look at my ruler
Two what
These are not inches
These are centimeters
The distance from point B to the line of symmetry is two centimeters
Can you predict the distance from the line of symmetry to this point
What do you think it is
Say it
Two centimeters
Good prediction
Let s check
Now we re going to check from this point to the line of symmetry
What s the distance
It s a little bit higher
It should be exactly the same but some of our drawings might be a little off
It should be two centimeters
Let s try point G Wiggle your pointer finger for me
Wiggle
Hi fingers
Hi fingers
Hi friends
I don t see all your fingers friends
Point to G Got you all listening didn t I
Please measure from the line of symmetry to point G I want to hear all of your voices
I want to see you measuring point G to the line of symmetry
What is our measurement friends
Say it
Six
65 what
Centimeters
65 centimeters
65 centimeters
Now my friends point to your point that is the opposite of G Look where my finger is
I m going to use my left finger now
Hi
Everybody say Hi left finger
Hi left finger
Point to that point opposite of G We re going to measure
It should be what
Six centimeters
65 centimeters
65 centimeters
Mine s pretty close
I hope yours is pretty close
I m going to make think right now
Really I m going to make you think
Take out your whiteboard and your markers
I would love to talk to you in just one second
I m going to make you think
I m going to make you think
Get your whiteboards out without talking
I m watching the clock
I want you to take one minute
I want you to write down what is true about a figure that is symmetric
What is true
Or what is the definition of a figure that is symmetric
Here are some words you might use
Symmetry symmetric reflection mirror distance point line of symmetry
Your job right now is to write three sentences or three facts about what does it mean if a figure is symmetric
Now instead of just saying vertices I wrote down points or vertices I want you to tell me what do you know about those points or those vertices
Instead of just writing mirror what does the word mirror have to do with symmetry or symmetric
Write it down
If you re explaining symmetry or a figure that is symmetric to Mr Oliver
If he walked in right now and he said I want you to use math vocabulary to explain what does it mean if a figure is symmetric what would you tell him
What would you tell him
You will be sharing this with a partner in 30 seconds
Make sure you have something
You could always start with I think or I wonder
If you re not sure good math students always ask questions
You may start with I wonder if you re not sure
You need to have something
I think or I wonder
Bring your marker
Bring your whiteboard
I want you to stand up and go find your thinking partner
You might need to walk by the front whiteboard
Im going to play Ms Marthas bell
By the time the bell has gone off you should be standing facing your thinking partner
Ready with your whiteboard with your marker
Go
Go
Find that thinking partner
Its almost up
High five your thinking partner please
Ms Martha can you help me matchup anyone that maybe is still sitting
Ali are you  do you need
You just need something
Whos your thinking partner
Is it Mia
Okay friends
Oh its really nice right
Right
I would like to see your eyes looking at me
Heres your job
The person with the longer hair will speak first but youre going to do Rally Robin
One person speaks then the other person speaks
One person speaks then the other person speaks
Put your brains together keep adding to your whiteboard
Keep adding to your whiteboard
If your partner says something and youre like Oh yes I agree with that write it down
Ready
Longer hair you speak first
Go
Go
Whos your partner hun
What do you know about its a figure that is symmetric
They have the same number of lines and the line segments are the same length
I would agree with you so the length here on this side would be the same length as the length on the other side you see what Im saying
I think they both have the same amount of biscuits from the length to the
Fourth graders please freeze
Thank your thinking partner
Thank you and head back to your seats
I love your bell
I love it too
All right awesome job my friends
I hope that got you out of your seat talking with someone new
Im going to pull some sticks so that we can hear from each other
I hope youre ready
Number 28
Cole
Number 28
Cole
Tell us something you and your partner talked about
Stand up nice and tall and classmates where should your eyes be
On Cole
Okay Cole go
I think its about length vertices and same shape
The same number of vertices and its the same shape on each side of the line of symmetry
Yes
Thank you for sharing
12
Eyes on Joel my friends
Wait Bryce where should your eyes be
Thank you friend
I think the symmetry is a little bit like here and the
Tell us the connection between mirror reflection and symmetry
Tell us more
Tell us more
How we did this we folded it and we  and we solved the reflection of the other half and then we mirrored it and then we wrote down the dot to match where we saw our vertex
Thank you
Please take out your math journal
Were going to move on to math journals
Lets see how quickly you can do it
You do not need your whiteboard anymore
I will keep your ruler
This should work for five minutes
Im watching Miss Marthas watching
My friends heres what you need right now
Your journal is page 184 184
184
Your journal is page 184
Ive heard T say the page number twice and group one
Brady would you do me a favor and would you please read nice and loud where it starts with the word each and Brady I sure hope that your classmates are being respectful and so they can hear your voice
Each person should  just put the letter  then draw the other
This looks fun doesnt it
Hey would you please follow the directions and then youll continue the directions from number one to number eight
You are filling in the other half of the symmetric figure
We have to use a ruler
Then my friends you will the try this which is a challenge and you may need your ruler for the try this
Im going to leave you for today and I will be back tomorrow
Please continue with the lovely Miss Martha
Oh Im so sorry Ill keep going
