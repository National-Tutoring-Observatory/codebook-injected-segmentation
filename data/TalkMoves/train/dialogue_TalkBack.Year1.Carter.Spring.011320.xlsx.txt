You have one more minute to get as far as you can
Prepare answers as a team please
Start with person number one
Ready go
Ready go
An improper number one for half I got 36
I have 3 56 and then four is going to be 23
For two thirds I got four eighths
No I disagree because two times six
six it looks
Because three times two is six
Sorry
68 is technically 34 and I rounded that up to a whole because I said a whole minus a half equals a half
I agree with
I convert the 12 to 48 and did it and that would be 28
Either way its halfway between half of them
3 x 3 is nine
3 x 3  9 thats right
3 x 4  12
Yes 912
I see what I did there
Whatd you get
About 15
I didnt get anywhere for number two
Wait what did you guys say for the last one
15 20 and
An estimate means coming up with your idea of what you think is
I know that 68 is over a half and so a little more than a half take away a half is going to be a little more than zero
Yes
I wouldnt expect a number with a five is what Im saying
No I was writing something better than
Okay back to me please
Thank you
Last week we were using the multiplication rule of our own to find common denominators using that strategy only one way to find a common denominator
Show me how comfortable you are using the multiplication rule to find a common denominator
Great fabulous
Thank you
I dont need those papers unless you specifically would like some help with it
It was just a warmup just to refresh your memory all right
Were going to skip slate today because we did our slate doing Bizzbuzz the game
Here is your math message
Work with a partner
One partner reads about factors on student reference book page 72 and lists all the factors of 36
The other partner reads about the multiples on the student reference book  and lists the first six multiples of the number eight
Tell your partner what you learned and share your list of numbers
He said one thing and it says  I noticed
Page 27 83 and 72
Yes so one partner reads about the multiples on page 72 and lists the first six multiples of the number 8 and the other one I think its just reverse of what he said
The other partner reads about factors on page 73 and lists all the factors of 36
All right
Why dont I have Hunter come here or Jackson go there
Okay
Thank you
Ready go
Ready go
Cant you just put the book in between you
One of you do 72 one of you do 73
Did I not give you guys books
Here
Yes
Yes theyre right over
Why dont you do the page thats on your side of the book and she does her page thats on her side of the book
Theres your book
Common multiples a common multiple is a number is common multiple of two or more numbers if it is a multiple of each of those numbers
Why are these bold
Because those are all the common multiples of that
What does that mean
It is a multiple of each of those numbers because theyre both common and theyre both in the two Theres two of the same numbers in
Two of what
Not just same numbers what kind of numbers
6  6 is 12
Thats common
Here its common because
See this right here thats your clue
Six a multiple of two and six is also a multiple
The multiple
Can you say that
Multiple
Theyre common because theyre both
Isnt 12 a common multiple of four and 12 also
Yes and then
The one that reads 73 will solve the factors of 36 the partner on page 72 will solve the first six multiples of eight
Then you compare your list
Does that make sense
Yes examples
Three and five are factors of 15
15 is the product of three and five
Three and five are a factor pair for 15
Counting numbers cant have more than one factor pair
One and 15 are another factor pair of 15 because 1 x 15  15
To test whether it
Is that making sense
Are you stopping and thinking
Just because you can read it it doesnt mean your thinking about it
Does that all make sense to you
Yes
Why are three and five factors of 15
Because five times one equals 3 x 5  15 because five times three Five 10 15
To test whether a counting number
If you flip it around then five times three
Yes because when you multiply them together it equals the product of 15
Another factor pair one and 15 also
Three times No three is a factor of 15 because three can go into 15
Evenly
Yes evenly
Good
Then five can go into 15 evenly
Good job
Way to go Jackson
Nice job
What are you creating
Im curious
These are the factors
All the factors of
I wouldve just started with It says the first six doesnt
No it says all the factors
List all the factors of 36 because I wouldve started with one one is factor of everything
Two
Three four
Two is Three
I wouldve put them probably in order is my point
Were doing them backwards
Yes four
Five is not
Six is seven isnt
Eight is it
Nine
No
No
Then thats it because all of them are going to match up with the ones on the list
You and your partner should be sharing your list of numbers and discussing what youve learned
Did you guys make your list like they asked
You guys are done
Yes
Why dont you work on math process while you wait okay
After you do the list and then you could make your list of the factors
Try some different once
Weve done one and two
Try
Im curious what is it that youre grappling with here
Youre trying to decide if three is a factor of 36
I know
Right now Im saying yes because theres 30 and six divided by three is
Two
Yes and because three goes into 36
Im smart
Then you just go in
Yes because you know that three goes into 30 10 times
13
Three goes into six twice
Three and 13
What about four
Four times what equals 36
Four times eight
Close
Thats 32
I meant nine
Four What times 10 is what
Take four away
Five will get you two
Six
What about seven
It wont be 36 right
Four times nine
Four goes in
Does five go in
No
What about your four
What about seven
Try seven
No seven is not a factor
Six
What about eight
Six times what is 36
Six times six
You know six is going on
Now youre going to do youre going to write one
Did you read this part about the factor rainbow
Because you know one matches 36 you know six times six is going to be the middle of this rainbow right
It connects to itself four is going to connect with nine three is going to connect with thirteen two is going to connect with  the other factor matches up with one of these is what Im trying to show you
If you finished go ahead and go to math boxes because some teams are still checking work
Youre at the oneminute warning
Okay
All right back to me please
It was excellent to see how well you were actually processing that information a lot of interaction going on between people and you talking it and discussing it helps you remember it rather than just listening to me talk about it
Thank you
Think for a minute what does the word factor mean
Im going to have you do a standup hand up pair up and go talk to somebody
What does the word factor mean
If you still have time talk about factor pair ready
Go
That was a reading
Good job
things that make up that number like a factor of five is obviously one because one is a factor of absolutely every single number
Multiply together to make five
You cant multiply three to make it a five
Yes it has to multiply It has to divide them evenly
Theres two multiples of five
Thank you I like that you went through that quickly
What is a factor
Adam
Its like adding it up 5  5  10 and 10  5 is 15
Say that again because Im not agreeing and I see people agreeing
Say it again maybe I misheard it please
Its like 5  5 is 10 where you just keep adding five
Yes I thought maybe people misheard
What youre describing is called something else
Say what Adam described in your hands say it out loud
Repeated addition
Multiples
There I heard it
Say it again louder
Multiples
He was describing multiples repeated addition is another way of thinking about it repeated addition of multiples
Didnt you make that connection when you and your partner interacted
Youre right Adam you have part of this but you have the wrong word attached with it all right
Multiples everybody say that multiples
Multiples
Thats that repeated addition
Factors are something else who would like to explain factor factor pair
Noah
A factor its not really a full multiplication problem its not like 2 x 2  4 that might be your target number or whatever the factor because youre trying to find all the factors for 36 to get to 36 so 2 x 18 thats a factor pair but if you have both of those numbers you want to take away one of those and just use one the numbers
Then when you have both of them its a pair
Its a factor pair
Do you want to add to that
Its like the addend of multiplication
Im trying to process what youre saying say that again
Its like an addend of multiplication the factor
Pick somebody thats doing this to respond to you
Amber
I see how you think its an addend but I really think its more of a number that is multiplied by another number to get the whole Like a target number but the number youre trying to get to like 36 like Noah was saying 18 is a factor because it can be multiplied by another number to get the whole number
The word addend is for when youre adding
Yes exactly for addition exactly
Factors are for when youre multiplying
Two numbers is for the pair
If its just saying one of the numbers that you would multiply by its called a factor but its two numbers multiplied together to make that target number like you said
What are the factors of 36
Lets say them in order whats the first one
Show me you can show me
Number one right
Is one a factor of every number
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Whats the next number
How do you know that two is the next number
How do you know
Think how you know
Youre going to talk with your face partner partner B goes first ready
Go
36 has even numbers in it and 2 is an even number
That is a beautiful answer
Nice job using your math thinking today
Okay how do you know that two is actually a factor of 36
Brodie R
Two is a factor of 36 because 36 is an even number and you can split it into two numbers equally
Sounds like what Jackson just said
Does anybody have a different way of explaining that
Falicia
It kind of goes with that but its like a factor of every even number
Yes I like your thinking
I see people nodding
Lets go on whats the next factor of 36
Good
is a factor of 36
This time is partners A turn to talk first youre talking with your face partner ready
Go
I like your thinking but what if the number was 37
Would three be a factor of 37
Why not
What makes 3 a factor of 36 but not 37
Because 3 x 2 would be 6 but not 7
Right very nice
Back to me please
Back to me please
How do you know that 3 is a factor of 36
Falicia
Because you could split it equally into three groups
You can split what into three groups equally
Thats one way to prove that dividing it
36 divided by 3 would be even groups
I like your thinking
Whats another way to prove that Margo
Another way to prove it is that I know that 3 x 11 is 33 and if you add another group of 3 it would be 3 x 12 which would be 36
Nice thank you
Whats another way to prove that Jackson
Because 36 its an even and an odd number and three is an odd number so 3 can go into 36 12 times
Im back at 36 is an even and odd number
Start with that statement
Explain how 36 can be an even and an odd number
Because 36 is an even number because 2 can go into 36
13 times but how is 36 also an odd number
If you think about it and you want to come back to us you can okay
Thank you
Missy had an interesting way of knowing that 3 is a factor of 36 Ema
I said 3 is a factor 36 because if you take 3 x 2 it would be 6
It wouldnt be a factor of 37 because 3 x 2 wouldnt be 7
You didnt explain the first part of how you knew that three was part of 36
Also three is a digit in 36
I see some puzzled looks here
Shelby
I see where youre going with this
I agree with the 3 x 2  6 and I think with the three is a digit I feel like youre trying to say that 3 x 10 would equal 30 and then you can take the 10 and the 2 and that would equal 12
Is that what youre saying
Yes
Kind of like partial products
Yes
People that are engaged are getting a lot out of this
People that are not stay with us because thats why were sharing multiple ways of getting our thinking
Rate how well you understand factor and factor pair at this point
Fabulous because this is really going to help you today and were going to go to the learning intention because I realized I didnt go over that
Heres the learning intention
Read this with me
Read this with me
I will use factors and multiples and common denominators to add and subtract fractions
Think for a minute
How would knowing factors maybe help you find the common denominator because weve really dug into the word factor here just now
When you have an idea stand up
How would using a factor help you find a common denominator
If you dont have an idea dont stand up but thats okay
If youre sitting you want to partner with somebody thats standing all right
Make eye contact with somebody so you for sure end up with somebody thats standing
We dont want two people sitting partnering
Have that conversation with that partner that youve made eye contact with
How would you use a factor to find a common denominator
Ready go
Ready go
Think about the multiplication rule that you were using for this today
Is four a factor of two
Yes
Or is two a factor in four
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Is two a factor of six
Yes
Yes because you multiply to get to that right
Two is a factor of all of these numbers because you multiply it to get to that
Two is a factor or three is a factor of all of these because you multiply it to get that
Whatever youre multiplying by its going to be a factor right
Yes
All right
Back to me please
Back to me please
Thank you
How do you know that you can use factors to help you find a common denominator
Martha
You can use factors to help you find a common denominator because say you had a fraction problem like 16  18 and you would need to find a common denominator
You could use factors for that
What is a number that has the factors of 6 and 8
Then you could find the least common multiple
Least common
Least common factor or multiple
Can we come back to this at the end
Because I think Im asking you to do stuff when you havent had a chance to practice but I think youre on the right track most definitely
Lets look at our success criteria
Read this with me
Read this with me
I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work
What was the strategy we learned last week with Ms Ferd and then me on Friday
Show me the action
The multiplication rule right
That was one strategy
Its kind of a lengthy one making lists of them but it would work
Thats what you have to be able to do
You have to be able to use one
Heres a graphic that goes with what you were just talking about with factors
Your eyes should be on the screen studying this
Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner about factors
Use this as your resource to help you talk about that with them
Its partner As turn to go first
Shoulder partner
Ready
Go
I see that maybe its like For one its connecting over 36 thats probably saying that 1 x 36 would equal 36
The 2 times the 18 36 yada yada so on so on
6 x 6 4 x 9 3 x 12
Like this except without the rainbows
I am just now getting the rainbow part
That connects to make a pair
Im just not seeing that
Even when you read it or saw it it seeing it again right
Factors and factor pairs
This has multiples on here
I dont see an example of multiples on here
To me this is all just factors and factor pairs because youd have to be counting by that number like Broon mentioned earlier
Yes
Yes
Yes
For this see how it says multiples for 20 maybe its saying that if you count by five till you get to 20 and you count by four till you get to 20 the multiple of each of them
Maybe you should add something if they want us to do that so that its real clear
At least this definitely shows factors and factor pairs
All right back to this slide
Do we need to keep going through the factors
We just looked at those right
As a rainbow
Multiple
Think for a minute what does the word multiple mean
Thats what Garett was just explaining to us right
Talk with your shoulder partner
Partner Bs turn what is a multiple
Count by that number right
2 4 6 8 10
Those are all multiples
Are they factors
Five
Thats one of the target numbers
Were trying to figure out all the numbers thats multiplied together to make that number
Does that make sense the difference here
Can you show me an action or a gesture that will help you remember multiples
I like that
Youre showing okay we have two now we have four now we have six now we have eight now we have 10
I see some people showing multiplying
I like what youre showing
Can you turn around and show everybody yours
See how shes showing its like multiplying but youre moving
Youre making a whole list of them
I cant do your gesture
A multiple of a number is the product of that number and another counting number
With factors thats a closed set
Theres no other factors
Its just one set
Multiples is it a closed set
No
No it goes on for infinity
You could keep counting that out forever
Keep going
Lets do some more practice with this
Lets come up on our slate with the factors of 12
What are the factors of 12 on our slate
What do you multiply together to get 12
Lets start at the beginning and count
1 x 12
One
Is 2 a factor of 12
Yes
Yes because 2 x 6
Six yes
Yes so 2 is
Then 3
Yes
Three times
3 x 4
Four yes
Three
Weve just said 3 x 4
Then 5 no
No
No
6
Yes because 6 x 2
Two yes
Then seven no
Eight no
Nine no
Ten no
Eleven no
Twelve yes
Do you remember that rainbow
How you connect it together so that you know that you have both numbers in the pair
Im going to rewrite these numbers
Share your factors with your shoulder partner
Partner B goes first
Ready go
Ready go
Is one times something equal 12
Yes so one should be on your list
What is one times what
One times
One times what equals 12
Anything times one is the number itself so what matches up
12 so put 12 down here that way youre doing two at the same time
Two does two going to go in 12
Yes
Yes two times what
Its an even number
Two times
Six
Yes
Yes
Yes
Put two then I put six back here
You can do them at the same time
What about three
Three should be like 3 x 6
No three times
Two
Four
Put a coma
3 x 4 is 12
Put three and four
Does five go into 12
No
Then we already know 6 does because we have it
Weve got all the factors
All right
Questions about the factors of 12
All right
Come up with multiples of 12
Just give the first five
First five
First five multiples of 12
You count by 12s so you start at 12 and then you have another group of 12 so 12 24 36
Thats what you
Share those multiples with your partner
Its partner As turn to go first
Ready
Go
12 24 and then 36
42 36 because youre adding 12 each time
2  4 would be six 1  2 would be three
Thats right 36
That makes sense now
36 and then
Back to me
Rate how well you could generate multiples for 12
Fabulous
Today we have worked on factors and multiples
We played a game to help us practice this
We were playing Buzz and Biz Buzz
We just did buzz I think and weve spent a lot of time with these words
Were going to really go quickly through the lesson tomorrow
You dont have homework tonight
really fast
Yes that did go really fast
I think its because we did so many other things today
If you would please put these items away
The home link if you need help with doing it keep it and get some help or take it home and do it for practice and bring it back for feedback or recycle it
After youve cleaned up for math please get your writing things out before joining me and rest for
Thank you
