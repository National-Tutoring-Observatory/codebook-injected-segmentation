Ethan are you done with the computer
No
He went to the bathroom
as soon as you get back  the division problem
Multiplication then subtraction so this is 12x2 24
3124 youve got to do order of operation
Friends youre down to three and a half minutes
Wheres Frankie
We dont have an answer  because I havent taught the lesson yet
I have eight people left
Im done
I am too
Youre doing yours
Alexander
What
Did you get it right
Probably
Yes I do
I do know that
Yes I got it correct
I was correct actually
Yes so am I
You have two and a half minutes
If you have 1 bill exchange it for
If you have 1 bill youve got that
Camila
Yes
I have math homework without a name
Ethan
Ethan
Yes
Can I give you 1
Did you do your homework
Yes I did my homework
Isabel
Not me
Then I have one without a name
Thirty seconds
Ethan do you have 1 bills
Yes
All right
The timer is up
Frankie
Go ahead and have a seat
Five four three two one zero
You got one minute Scarlette of your recess
Doesnt matter I think
It matters to me
Im ready to start
Im going to do math
Math is going to be a little different today
Were going to try something a little different
First I want to look at the learning targets so you know what were doing
Theres going to be a few different parts of math today
Were going to be going through some different things
Were not going to come up in groups today
Were going to do whole group but were going to be moving through some different things
Today the learning target is I can practice strategies for finding common denominators and use common denominators to add and subtract fractions
Day one we learned how to find common denominators
Were going to use that strategy and possibly some other strategies to help us now add and subtract the fraction
I know that I can understand this when I can make any list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until I found equivalent fractions with the common denominator see if one denominator is a multiple of others
Were going to play a game that has to do with multiples
If so its also a common denominator or multiply the two original denominators and use their product as a common denominator
Right here when it says practice strategies these are the three strategies that were going to use
One you already did when you multiplied by a two by a three by a four
You did both of those
Thats one of the strategies here
Im going to show you two others today
The first thing that I want us to do is look at this short little video
Short by being an hour long
Right
Scarlette and I decided to order a giant sandwich for lunch and split it
Scarlette said we have to cut it in half
I reminded him that we can cut it in as many pieces as we want
As long as we create an equivalent fraction to one half well still get an equal share
Lets take him through it step by step
The first step is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number
This is what we did yesterday
Those of you that have turned it in everybody got a three
That tells me that you understood how to do this strategy
is mine in there
I dont know is it
Ill have to look
Step two
I told Scarlette it doesnt matter what number you use as long as you multiply the top and bottom with the same number
Were starting with our fraction 12 because that means well each get an equal share of the sub
Lets choose the number three and multiply it by the top and the bottom
Now all we have to do is multiply to find the product
When you multiply 12 by 33 you get 36 12 and 36 are equivalent fractions
That means if we cut the sandwich in  pieces we would get three pieces each wed still be getting the samepair as if we had cut the sandwich in half
This was just a quick little thing the next thing that were going to do were not going to talk in between because we have a lot that I want to accomplish today and the talking in between is not going to be helpful
The next thing that youre going to do with your table and I cant remember if weve played this game before but its called buzz games so you say buzz bizz or bizz buzz
Heres what you do youre going to stand in a circle and youre going to choose a leader
Henry put that away
The leader can change each time you play and what youre going to do is youre going to pick any number between three and nine as the leader and the number if I picked three then thats the buzz number
The leader also chooses the stop number if I picked 3 and my stop number was 30 then we know how long were going
You cannot pick a number past 100 for your stop number 100s the biggest that you can go
Then the player to the left of the leader begins the game by saying one play continues clockwise each player saying either the next whole number or buzz
The buzz number is three so it goes one two buzz
Four five buzz then it keeps going
You will say buzz every time thats its a multiple
Then if you decide to do biz buzz if you want to challenge it then the leader names two numbers
This first round just play buzz maybe do two to three rounds just playing buzz
Then if you feel confident where you can add two numbers then you can play bizz buzz
The difference with biz buzz is with bizz buzz you have the buzz numbers six and the bizz numbers three here it goes
One two buzz if three is the bizz number
Four five bizz buzz because three and six are multiple so itd be biz buzz
Seven eight
Bizz because its only a multiple of three
Oh I get it
Im going to show you guys
You guys stand up with me
Im going to show you guys buzz
This team come up here
Camila I need you paying attention stand up here
Im going to do an easy one
Scoot over were making a circle
Im going to do an easy one Im going to do 5 and were going to stop at 40 and its just buzz
You start
One
Two
Buzz
No its five so you say three
Three
Four
Buzz
Whats after five
Six
Six seven
Eight
Its nine
Ten
Yours is buzz
No buzz
Lets stop a minute
The reason that Logan said buzz is because the numbers five so he says buzz
Any multiple of 5 so 5x2 10 thats a buzz and whats going to be the next buzz word
15 then
20 25 30 35 40
Were stopping at 40 lets see how fast we can go
One
Two
Three
Four
Buzz
Six
Seven
Eight
Nine
Buzz
Buzz
No or yes
No youre 16 because she said buzz for 15
Buzz
Buzz
Buzz
Buzz
30 buzz
We stop there because thats 40
Camila come up here
This computer is going to be like Whoa this girl cant stop talking come sit in my chair
Does everybody understand buzz
Yes
Yes
Now were going to do bizz buzz this is an element of challenge
Im going to choose numbers
Three is buzz and five is bizz and our stopping number this time is
Its just 60
Your stopping number would be five or something
No it has to be at least 10
Here we go
One
Two
Buzz
Buzz bizz
Six
Seven
Eight
Buzz
Buzz
This is harder
Its a buzz because 3 goes into 12 right
I know
Bizz 15
What should 15 be friends
Bizz
Bizz
Oh
Bizz
Bizz
Buzz
Buzz because 3 and 5 go into 15 so bizz buzz
16  buzz
Jackson do I need to move you
You should be turning around watching
Jackson come over here I want you paying attention
What are we on
Do I need to move anybody else
No
Its bizz
Oh no its buzz
No hes 24
Oh
Put that away
Hes busy
Put it away
24 is what friends
Bizz
No its buzz because three goes into it
25 would be
Buzz
Bizz
Bizz
Bizz
What can go into 27
Three so shes buzz
Buzz
Shes buzz because she is bizz
Shes bizz and shes
Buzz and shes bizz
What was your number
27 28
Whats 30
Its buzz
Jared whats 30
Bizz
Buzz buzz
Bizz buzz
Both of those
Both of those go in
I said bizz buzz
Were going to stop at 30 even though I said 60
I want you to stand up and play
Stand up
Wait what
Are we playing with our teams
Yes play with your time
Whos the leader
I will
Whats the buzz number
Just pick three or nine
Nine
Okay
Were going to end at 81
Were not on that
End at 81
Start
Whoever gets it wrong were starting it this way
Whoever gets it wrong has to sit down
Well say  three
Three
At the end theres a prize
Ill give you one of my
I mean buzz
I dont want your dirty bike
Seven
Eight
Whos the leader
Aiden
Whats your number
Five
Okay
Were going to dwellat 9 and end at 81
Were playing bizz buzzright now
Its like whenever you
Whos the leader
Whats your number
Then you just say buzz
What happens if you get it wrong though
Its buzz
Nine
Buzz
Buzz
38 39
Buzz
Any number with buzz
Wait you did it by five
Five
Everyone sits out for the whole round
Were not adding extra rules
No youre right
Buzz
Buzz
Three four
Seven
Eight nine
13 14
Come on
56
Buzz
Buzz
Buzz
No no no
35 buzz
Were not 36
Yes I know were not
Just multiples of five
Whoever says the wrong number is out you have to sit out
One two three
Buzz
Buzz
Buzz
Seven eight nine
Buzz
How high are we going
To 60
Go ahead and have a seat
We all lost
at your table
Eagle highfive
Once eagle highfives twice
Last time eagle highfive
Thank you
I should have everybodys attention
Yes Sofia
Shes the T
The thing that I want to ask you is how did you figure out the multiples
When you played the buzz game how did you figure out the multiples
Ethan
Ethan
Me and our team we did fives and we were trying to go up to 60
It waseasy because all youve got to do is count by five
Every fifth one was a multiple
Jared howd you do it
We did 5 and 60 but we helped each other out like Frankie since he just got here we had to explain to him
He didnt really get it until we changed it from nine to five
We all just got confused
Scarlette
We did to 100 and it was pretty
Sofia
since we were getting it with fives we decided to make it a little bit trickier
With elimination
For example Layla said one Victoria said two and the Matteo said two
Since he said the number he had to sit down
Technically we tried to make it harder because it was super easy
You shouldve been listening you had your shirt up your nose
You were like this and you were talking
They did an elimination
If you didnt say the right number or you didnt say buzz at the right place then you were eliminated
The next thing that you are Ill wait
Ill wait
The next thing youre going to do is youre going to get a card
It could be a group of two it could be a group of three it could be a group up to five
You are going to find people that have the same equivalent fraction that you do
Youre not going to look at this side
This side is not going to help you
Youre going to look at the fraction side and youre going to find people that have the same number you do
Just wait until I give everybody their cards
What if you dont have an equivalent fraction like zero zero
Everybody has at least one equivalent fraction
No thats not an option
Everybody has at least one match
Stand up find your partners
Sit down with your group
Five four You should be sitting with your group
Three two If you dont think you have a group stand over here
Two one zero
These people that dont think they have a group lets check to see if they go with anybody
Pay attention
Stop bending the cards
68
Does anybody think that their fraction is equivalent to 68
No
Its 23
23
That would be six
No three doesnt go into eight
Lets see
What about 410
16
68 lets see
Does anybody have 116
No
What
Does anybody have 14
Does anybody have 34
No Im doing it now
I know somebody asked for34
Okay you two are partners
You two are partners go sit over there
This one lets look at this one
1012
If youre talking please stop
We have 410
Okay 1012
Ms Carroll we have 410
Its 410 and 1012 equivalent
Lets see
16
Some of you has 16
Lets see
We may have 56
I do
You too
What do we have here 69
23
212
Does 410 go
Is there 16
Jackson has 12
12
Hey what about 410
We have 210
What
Listen
Listen friends
Violet just said 24 wouldnt Jackson go with the 24 group
Yes
This whole group should be one
This whole group right here
You two Jackson and Sofia and Hannah
810
Who should Frankie be
810
Here you go eagle high five
With your fraction cards there is a visual that shows you
You can match it up and see if it matches
Thats one way
You can do the strategy that you learned on Tuesday where you multiply the smaller one by the same thing with the numerator and the denominator and see if it matches
Violet
There is a really easy way you can get some of these card and you can go to a number line
Theres also a number line that you can look and see on the number line if its marked on the same place on the number line
Theres three different ways just in checking in the cards to see if you have the same fraction
With your group check and see we match some people up but couldnt find their partners
Check and see if that worked
Check the number lines check the visual do the multiplication trick and see
Scarlette are you and Frankie together
Yes
Whats your numbers
25
25 so its a
Whos 410
Whos 410
Ijust said that
Theyre 410
Whos 410
Whos 410
You should be with 25
Go check it
Anyone else got a 110 or 115
No
When youre done checking come bring me your card and go sit back down
Can we go back with our 110
Yes go sit back down
Eagle high fiveHenry bring me that card and  rolling it up
Eagle high five
In todays math message youre going to need your SRB page 72 and 73
The math message says Thank you for staying quiet I so appreciate that
Im finding the right page
Work with a partner
One partner reads about multiples in theSreference book on page 72 and lists the first 6 multiples of 8
The other partner reads about factors on page 73 and lists all the factors of 36
Then youre going to share with your partner what you learned in your list of numbers
Partner with somebody at your team
Is there anybody that doesnt have
Then take A and B
Here there should be three As
Are you guys partners
Yes
Then you cant both be A
Do you want to be A
Listen up
I want A
Listen up put your hands down
Were getting confused
Stella come here
Stella and I have decided to be partners
Do you want to be A or B
A
Shes A Im B Scarlette were the same partners so shes A and Im B were not both A
Youre going to read page 72 and list the multiples of 8
Im going to read page 73 and list the multiple or the factors of 36 Im going to write that up here
Thats what youre going to read
Youre going to read and youre going to find out
A is page 72 the first 6 multiples stop talking of 8
Partner B is reading page 73 stop talking factors of 36
The reason I didnt pick a number is I want you to find all the factors of 36 theres only a short number
When you find the multiples of 8 it could go on and on so thats why Im telling you to find 6
Everybody should have an SRB open either to page 72 or 73
You should be reading and nobody should be talking for probably at least three minutes to four minutes while youre doing you work then youll share
Everybody has a partner right
No
It should be quiet while were reading
It should be quite while youre reading and doing the work whos your partner
Im reading
It should be quiet while youre reading
Then I found that  the 48
Youre supposed to be 36
Did you write it down
Write them down
I didnt even get a paper
the paper
You can write in one of your slates
I didnt even get one
You dont have a slate
No I didnt even get one
I dont understand
Theres one back there
You got a piece of paper
Okay
Do you want to be A or B
You guys should have a breakdown and you shouldnt be talking
Right now were reading are you A or B
Wyatt youre A so youre reading page 72
A is part of that too
