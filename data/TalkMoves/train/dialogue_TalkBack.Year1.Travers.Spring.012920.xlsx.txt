group gets a point
Yes we figured that out yesterday
The other thing that theyll need in a few minutes is aSreference book
Do you use those as partners
Yes or usually I spin and have one person go get them which we can do
Great yes
All right would you please start with your whiteboard and marker
You will need your math journals in a few minutes but were starting with just whiteboards and markers okay
All right
My friends are mental math today is helping us think about fractions
Is the sum greater than one whole or less than one whole
Greater than one whole or less than one whole
When we look here we have 24  14
If you need to write it down on your whiteboard you can
What were going to do is if you think the answer is greater than one whole show me a thumbs up
If you think the answer is less than one whole show me a thumbs down
You might need to you might not
24  14
Three two one show
Answer is
Answer is
Down
Less than
Less than
Well say less than or greater than one whole
34
Less than
25  25
Answer is
Answer is
Less than
Less than
45 is less than a whole right
46  36
Greater than or less than one whole
Answer is
Answer is
Greater than
Is there a volunteer willing to share why they had greater than
Claire
Because if you have 36 and 36 then it would be 66
If you had 26  36 it would be a 56
Then we have 36  46 then you would have 76
Which is
When the numerator is seven is greater than six we know its
Greater than a whole
Greater than a whole
Excellent
Lets do this middle one right here in green
Were just going to skip around
Sometimes Travers will do things exactly like Miller sometimes Ill do things different
38  48  28
Do we think thats bigger than one hole or less than a hole
Im waiting for a few thumbs
38  48  28
Answer is
Answer is
Greater
Greater than
Why do you say greater than Cooper
Because half of 88 is 4
I put two
You know what Im going to pause us right now because Im just getting the sense that were not all listening
Cooper will you start again please
Yes
I had 38 and 28 and I put them together to make 58
Then 58  48 is 98 which is more than one whole
Then I have a question
Theres something that I want all of us to I want us to practice the language of Id like to revise my thinking because thats what good math students do
Your brain might originally think something but then after you hear how other people solve you might change your thinking
Thats really a good thing in math
Its a great thing to be able to say I revise my thinking because and then explain why youd want a different answer now
Yes my dear
You said
My dear
is one
Its one whole
One whole
Well I dont think theyve set that problem out that way
Have they
Do you see one where it one whole
No
There you go
Okay
All right
Lets do one more my friends
58  58
Greater than one whole or less than one
You skipped some T2
I know I did
The answer is
She already said that shes going to
Greater than
Is it greater than or less than one whole
Greater than
Great
Austin can you tell us why its greater than one whole
I know that 5  5 is 10 and 10 is greater than 8
108 is greater than one whole
Yes
Yes okay
My friends would please leave your whiteboards on your desk
Im going to have you come to the carpet please facing the screen
Just like that
Yes
Thank you for coming to the carpet so quickly and quietly
Ms Miller when theyre on the carpet do they have a partner to talk to
Well they dont really have an assigned partner I just tell them to talk to someone around them
Great
Well its usually like
Or whos next to them
Okay
All right
Excellent
My friends our learning target today is were learning about how to use a line plot
I want you to think about We come up here
Were going to be recording data on a line plot and answering questions regarding the data
The data that we look at today guess who its about
You
What
Yes
Were going to be collecting some data about each other and then organizing the data to make it makes sense for us
Okay
We will use data to create a line plot and answer questions
The data will be about us
Whats a line plot
Thats our first question
What is that
Were going to be looking at something called a scale line plot
Then we also have an important word to think about today
Our math vocabulary word to think about today is interval
Everybody say Interval
Interval
Okay lets think about what that means
What is a scale
A scale line plot and an interval
Id like to hear all of your voices please
Ready
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
You can figure out the scale of a line plot by looking at a set data
Identify the smallest minimum and the largest maximum numbers in your data set
Pause there
Were going to have a data set a set of a bunch of numbers
We need to find the
Minimum
And the
Maximum numbers
Thats going to help us
Ready
Ready
Ready
I want to hear all your voices were on the word these
Ready
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
These can be the first and last numbers on your scale
Then figure out a way to represent the rest of your data
The numbers on your scale should have the same interval or space between
I want everyone to think what does the same interval or space between them
I want you to high five a partner standing by you
Show me who youre going to talk to by high fiving that person
Show me who you will talk to and then make a team of three if you need to
I want to clarify what does this last sentence mean
The numbers on your scale should have the same interval or space between them
Talk with your partner
Go
Go
Are you guys talking right here
Yes
Okay
Its cool
Its something that happens at the like a pattern that happens
Lets say theres a pattern that happens  you will find something
Theres a pattern that happens
Thats technology
Theres a pattern that
Each number has the same
have to find the same thing
With an equal amount of space
Yes
I think I heard a great conversation over here
Would you be willing to share
Okay
said we should have the same interval or space between them
What does that mean and why is that important
I think it means like how many inches they are
We need a unit of measurement to know what unit were talking about in our set of data
I think thats a great start
Would you call on the next person for us please
Austin
Me and Aiden said that an interval or space between them means the difference or the amount between
When you say them what is them
The difference in between the
The numbers in a line plot
The unit
Student
Okay excellent
Great
Ethan will you add on to that please
Yes I also wanted to share
Excellent
We both have a bunch of paper and then
The spaces between
When were talking about interval we want to think about that as an equal or same space between the numbers
Yes between the two of them
You got it
Lets look at this fine plot
We have scientists measured stag beetles in Europe
I dont know what that is but I dont know
Can you picture a little beetle in your head right now
Everybody picture a beetle
Okay back to our data
Ill wait until youre ready
Thank you
Here are the measurements
Whats the unit
Inches
Inches
In order from the
Smallest
To the
Largest
We have one and a half to two inches two and a half inches and three inches
This is the line plot that represents the data
The line plot shows measurement data in Whats the interval
Half an inch
Half an inch interval
I want you to think right now what are some questions you could I want you to ask a question about this set of data
Thats tricky isnt it
Yes
Lets look at this line plot and lets think to ourselves What question could we ask about this set of data
You want to start
I have this one question that goes one has two and one onehalf
Thats what was confusing
Thats a question you have
Okay
I have a question for you guys
How many insects were measured
Lets take partners you were just talking with
How many insects were measured
High five
I want to hear your voices
I want to hear your voices
How many insects were measured
11
20
22
Im hearing a couple of different answers
Aiden would you be willing to share
I think
Thank you for starting us
I
I appreciate you just jumping right in there and sharing your thinking
Thats what good math students do
Is there anyone else willing to share
Josh
I counted the top I got 22
How
I counted the top it came out as 11
You counted this first row
How many points in that set of data was
11
11
Then the bottom had the exact same number
I just added eleven
Excellent
Then 11  11 was
22
Excellent
I did it a little different
Did you do it a little different Paris
What I did was I knew that there were nine and the two inches
Then a seven in two and a half
I took 3 and I added it to the 7 to get 10 plus the 9 plus the 3 to get 22
You actually looked at the actual line box and used some strategies to count them
Excellent
I have another question for you
What is the measurement of the longest beetle
What is the measurement of the longest beetle
Tell your partner
Go
Go
High five
Great job getting back to zero friends
The measure of the longest beetle is
Say it
Three and a half
Three and a half what
Inches
Three and a half inches
What is the measurement of the shortest beetle
Tell your shoulder partner
One and a half
One and a half what
Inches
Thank you
You have to remember those labels in math right
Lastly this one is going to make you do a little thinking
What is the difference between the measure of the longest and the shortest insects
Think about that first
What is the difference between the longest and the shortest insects
Tell your shoulder partner
Go
Go
When youre ready to share give me a thumbs up
Noah do your
I think its four halves is the differenceone and one half to minimum
Noah Im hearing you say four halves from one and one half to three and one half
Or two wholes because theyre both that one half and one plus two equals three
Thats how I know its two
Good thinking
Then I revise my thinking with the
Noah what Im hearing you say is if you count by each interval each interval is half an inch and there is four halves or if you count three and a half minus one and a half you would get two inches
The difference is two inches
Friends I wanted you to just be able to see a line plot and recognize how to look at a line plot
Now I want to have you Would you please go get your whiteboard and markers and come back to your same spot on the carpet
Go
Go
Can you do this by the time the bell is done
Ready
Ready
Ready
Thank you so much for being ready
Here we go
We have some more data here
Chuck planted sunflower seeds
Two weeks later he measured the heights of the plants
Here is the data
My friends we have this list of data and we have some directions here how to help us organize the data
Our first step to organize and think about the data is to put the measurements in order from what
Smallest to largest
Lets find out the smallest piece of data in the group
What do you think it is
Look at the data
What is the smallest measurement
3 12
3 12
3 12
Please write that at the top of your whiteboard
Do we have any other 3 12
No
Its the only one
Do we have any 3 34
Yes
We have three
Ready my friends we have 3 34
Please write it
3 12
3 12
We started with the smallest piece of data
It was 3 12
Then we have 3 34
How many times do you see 3 34
Four
One two three four
One two three four
You should write down 3 34 how many times
Four
Four times
Right now my friends we have written down 3 12 3 34 3 34 3 34 3 34
Will you please look at your shoulder partners whiteboard and make sure that were all in the same place
Give your shoulder partner a tip if they need to catch up with us on something
Next
Whats our next biggest measurements
4 12
Four inches
How many times do we have four inches
Three times
One two three
One two three
Please write four three times in your set of data
All right then
Then what is our largest piece of data
4 12
4 12
4 12
Now my friends I want you to draw a line plot just like this but with this data
Draw a line plot for the data
Which numbers do you use as the first and last number on your scale
My friends our intervals is what we have to think about right now
We have half inches and quarter inches
What do you think the interval should be on our scale
Thats what we have to stop and think about
I love how Im making some of you do some thinking
Can I please have  a piece of paper
Would you please talk with the person sitting next to you
What should our interval be for this set of data
We have to look at the denominator
Was it 4 34
I couldnt
You have your data on your sheet
I didnt get to write it all down
It goes one half and then
By the way I love how you got started
I can tell that you were thinking about your interval
What measurement did you use to set up your line plot
Im seeing a lot of great thinking right now
Friends I want us all to think about if our smallest piece of data is Whats our smallest
3 12
Our largest is
4 12
4 12 right
Were doing inches but we also have some 14 inches in between 34 of an inch
When Im setting up my data for my line plot I want to think about if this was three inches and this was four inches
Well we have 4 12 this should probably be five
Lets start with our line plot set up like this my friends
We need the same amount of space
Thats what an interval is
We need the same amount of space in between each of our intervals
Whats in between three and four
Whats in the middle of three inches and four inches
3 12
3 12
3 12
Whats in the middle of four inches and five inches
4 12
4 12
4 12
Is it okay if I did this
We have to have the same amount of space in between
Three inches and 3 12 whats in the middle
3 14
3 12
3 12
In between three inches and four inches I need to make sure I have my quarter inches marked
Then in between four inches and five inches we have 4 12 in the middle
Im going to have everyone show me their whiteboards in a minute and Im really going to be checking for your intervals at the bottom
We need to set up our intervals so that our line plot is set up correctly
Whats in between 4 inches and 4 12
You can look at how many spaces we have between 4 inches and 5 inches
4 14 onequarter of an inch
4 14 of an inch then 4 12 and 4 34
Now that we have our intervals set up now we can put our line plot correctly
We can place the Xs on our line plot right
Yes
Our smallest is 3 12
How many 3 12 did we have
One
One
Whats next
3 34
How many 3 34 did we have
Four
I thought we had five
Let me go back to the data and check
One two three four
One two three four
Was there a five
Yes I thought so
3 34 ones two three four
You need a half
Then my friends when we listed out our data what was our next biggest data point
How many times did four occur in the measurement above
Three times
Three times
Three times
One two three
One two three
Whats the next data point
4 12
Do we have any 4 14
I dont think so
No we dont have any
We dont have any but we still need that
We need 4 14 of this still on our line plot because it shows us correctly the data separated into intervals
We dont have any 4 14
Do we have any 4 12
Yes
How many
Two
One
Two
Lets look at the data
One
Two
Two
We have two
Here is four inches and four inches
Oops time is up
Are we at 4 12 now
Yes
How many 4 12 did we have
Two
Two
Two
Two
Two
Wait two
Yes
Oh my God yes two
Is that the highest
Yes its the highest
thats the highest
Heres 4 12 and 4 12
Is that the greatest
Yes
My friends this is our line plot
The other thing our line plot means is we need to know what it represents
What is this line plot all about
About
The distance or how long the stag beetle
What does this information represent on the bottom
The No
Length
Length
In what
Inches
In inches
Good thing its not feet or miles we dont want a three and a half foot stag beetle
Thats why its so important that we have our unit
Or three and a half miles
We dont want a three and a half mile stag beetle
Let me ask you a question
In the data how many stag beetles were about four inches
Three
How many stag beetles were about four inches
I want to hear your voices
I want to hear your voices
Ready
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Three
Three
We have stag beetles and we know that because we have three Xs each X represents one piece of data
I thought these were plants
These are beetles
Okay
Are you ready
You know what Max youre right
Hes totally right
Look at this first one was stag beetles
Oh my goodness its a good thing you guys are careful readers because sometimes Im not
Max awesome job my friend
My friends T2 its not a stag beetle its a what
Sunflower
Max thanks for setting us straight
We appreciate you
Yep
Guess what
The rest of math today is data about you
I need you to go put away that whiteboard and get out your math journal and a pencil
Go
Go
Im going to show you the page when you want to be ready

Ms Miller would you be my thinking partner please
I would love to
Ladies and gentlemen youre going to be using a tape measure today
Im going to give you some directions quickly and I need to know that you are with me
Show me youre ready
You will be using centimeters today and we are measuring to the nearest half centimeter
You want a partner are going to measure each others heads
I have rules about the tape measure
You need to press the button gently and keep your hand on it while you are pulling it in and out because if you dont sometimes they break
You need to be gentle and careful
Ms Miller and I Would you do mine first
Shes going to measure all the way around my head and then shes going to show you on the screen what the measurement is to the nearest half centimeter
Ms Miller is going to drop it
Mason go to your seat
Now carefully put your finger where it is Ms Miller and now carefully show it on the dot camera
Ready
Ready
Ready
Hey I need all of your eyes up here
I got to show you something first though
When I was measuring if you noticed the zero starts here not at the end of the tape measure
Well make sure you start right here at the zero not at the plastic piece
Yes
When I wrapped it around I made sure that this where it ended right here where that five is I made sure that that was lined up with the zero Christian
Now if you notice look 40 50
50
51 52 53 54 55
Now if she said Measure to the nearest half does that mean that it will always fall on the half
No
No
No
Friends youre going to be always looking wherever her finger was closest to the 55
If it was closer to this middle mark the middle mark is the half centimeter
Heres 54 centimeters 54 and
A half
half centimeters 55
You need to look at exactly where your finger is were measuring to the half centimeter or the whole centimeter
This is T2s just happened to be closer to the whole
Your partners might be closer to half
Just be careful you have to start it
What if you end it like
Were going to make sure that everybodys with us
When I wrapped it around I made sure that that five met the zero
Then notice that I wrapped it around from her forehead to the back of her head
My friends your directions are on the top of your journal page
Before you get up and find your thinking partner I want you to read all of number one in your head
Go
Go
So that you know what to do
Please read number one in your head
You have a question Paris
No Im holding it
Youre ready
Oh my gosh I love when youre ready
My friends you have not very long no time to waste
Three minutes with your thinking partner
You are going to write down your head size in your journal
Your thinking partner helps you find it
You write down in your head size in your journal
Your thinking partner is not the same
Different
before
Ms Miller would you please call the first thinking partner in each group to come get a tape measure
Okay
These people are going to come and get a tape measure
Ryan Hannahn Aiden Christian Kyle Fern Mason Paris Noah Jayden Josh Brian and Michael
Id loved to see who your thinking partner is so you know who to go to
Ms Miller do you have a timer
I do
Ms Miller where do we set a timer for
You need to go find a thinking partner measure both partners heads
Ready three minutes
Go
Go
Maybe check it again just to be sure
Check it again
Sometimes you might have to measure twice to be sure
All the way  plastic piece
I know
Can you put your finger right there
I would agree
Do you agree
Yes so thats
Now show her where we were
closer to 49 12
Friends you have one minute to be back at your desk
Would you please take your tape measure back to the baskets
Take your tape measure back to the baskets and head to your desk
We are looking for the kids back in their seats
I love how Colins showing us hes ready
All right
Ms Miller is going to call your name
Youre going to tell us your herd size and T2 is going to record it
Its perfectly fine to have those two finishing up
Were going to start collecting your data
All right
Im going to Lets start here at this team
Tell me what was your head measurement please
I got 53 and one half
Thats what I got

I have the smallest head
Here Josh
My friends heres what we have to start thinking about
Ms Millers going to check something but you need to do some thinking
Show me your eyes so I know youre with me
Show me your eyes please
When you think about whats our smallest what is our largest and what will our intervals be
Do we have an adjustment
Did we need to revise on our thinking
We need to revise
56
56
56
Guys sometimes when we see If you noticed we had like an outlier
We have to doublecheck our data
If you notice these were all in the 50s
and then we had a 64
Hes actually 56
We shuld to doublecheck
This is our last data
We need to think about this with our teams smallest largest and how are we going to set up the intervals on our line plot
My friends would you please talk to your tablemates about what is the smallest what is the largest and how are we going to set up the intervals on our table
Go
Go
Show your partners
T2s hand is up
Show your partners
Thank you
All right
Where did your thinking land Paris
We said 49 would be the smallest and 56 would be the biggest
If you have similar thinking to Pariss team please stand up
49 has the smallest and say it again
56 as the largest
As 56 as the largest
Looks like we have a pretty good majority
We agree
Okay thank you
Lets see sit down
Paris did you guys talk about interval
Not yet
Was there any team that talked about an interval
We were confused
I am so glad that you said that
If you think about when we set up this data should we do whole inches should we do half inches or centimeters should we do quarter centimeters
How do we know
Put your hands down
Look at your face partner at your table group
Now talk to that face partner
What are you thinking about our interval how we should set up our line plot
Go
Go
How are we going to set it up
Why do you think is that
Whole centimeters
Half centimeters
Quarter centimeters
I think we should put them off by half
Why do you think halves
Actually whole
Three two one zero voices
Christian would you share the thinking that your team had about the intervals
We thought that we should do half centimeters because most people got half I think and we use centimeters to measure our heads
I heard Christian say We think we should set up our line plot in half centimeters because we have to make sure we represent all of the data up there
Stand up if you have similar thinking
We have to be careful listeners when T2s teaching
Similar thinking
Please sit back down
Stand up if you have different thinking
About what
Stand up if you would like to add on or have a different idea or comment about how we should set up our line plot in intervals
Stand up Max
Max
Can I add
Yes
I think we should also set up in half centimeters because a lot of the numbers are halves between each of the numbers like 54 and 54 and a half and then 55 and then theres 54
We dont want to leave out any data
We want to make sure we have enough room on our line plot to represent all of the data
Cooper you were going to say something similar
I was going to say if we do ones
Get your pencils ready
Lets start setting it up and Ill keep listening to you
Okay
If we do one as the interval were going to skip some because one cant justcut in half interval
That would be a
What is our smallest piece of data
What is our smallest number in the set
49
49
49
Im afraid were not going to have enough room but well see
Next will be 49 and
We have no 49 and
I cant do it still
Thats a good
What do you think Ms Miller
Someone said we dont have a 49 and a half
That was Anna
Why do we still have to put 49 and a half on it
I thought we were counting all of these on here
one half as the interval
Yes exactly
My friends we have to make sure that our line plot is set up with equal space between every single data point
We have to represent the half inches and whole inches on the whole line
Remember even on the example she showed in the SRB there were some that werent marked with any axis
You have to have equal intervals
If you skipped over a half then you wouldnt have an equal interval
Make sure youre writing down what T2 is writing
I think the large interval should be 56  because we wont fill it all
Yes were not going to fill it up
While were doing this my friends I might be confused about what these numbers represent
What will our label be on part of the line plot
What do these numbers represent
Centimeters
Distance around our heads in centimeters
Good job
I think that should be
Its the perfect amount
What about circumference
You definitely could use the word circumference
Or could we just write centimeters
I would add the word distance so that you know its not just a straight line because we are looking at the distance around something
T2 you said a 53 5 and a half
Thank you
I will revise my math writing because thats what the math students do
Perfect
How about that it worked out just perfectly
Just barely perfect
My friends before we go ahead and complete our line plot what should the title of our line plot be
Circumference
Class
Class what
Heads
Class head sizes
I love it
Dont forget that titles need
Capitals
capitals on all the important words
What about the bottom
You didnt put capitals
Its a label its not a title
Good question
Here we go my friends
Wait I missed that
Ms Miller would you mind being  White pointing to the data
Sure
and perhaps using another color to cross out the data that we use
Perfect
Our smallest is 49 right
Yes
How many times did 49 happen
One
A nice neat X in that box
Do we have any 49 and a halfs
No
No
No
Did we have any 50 centimeters
Yes
Lets count how many
One two
Two students in ourSShave a head size of 50 centimeters
Hannah and Alyssa
Did we have any 50 and one halfs
Yes one
Just one
Just one
Just one
Just one
Just one
Just one
Just one
Just one
I will come around and look at your journals in just a moment
I hope youre keeping up
Whats next Ms Miller
Do we have a 51
51
51
We one
We have two
Just two
Yes
Two

Excellent
Thank you
51 and a half
51 and one half
No
No
No
Zero
My friends do I put anything in the 51 and one half

Ladies and gentlemen I would like you to please giveT1a round of applause for helping me with the data
I would like you to look at your thinking partner the one you measured your head with look at your person wave at them say Thank you for being my partner
Thank you for being my partner
I want you to stop and think about something else
What is one piece of information that if Mr Oliver walked in right now and he said What are you working on
What are you guys working on
What are these Xs
What would you tell him that we worked on today in math
I want you to think
Why did we do these activities
Would you please stand up and go high five your thinking partner the one that youre matched up with on the board right now
Stand up
I want to see all kids standing and try finding their thinking partner
Longest pair Id like you to talk first
What did we work on today and why did we work on it
Go
Go
What are those things called
data right
We collected some data
Four three two one zero
Please have a seat
Were going to turn our eyes and ears to number four
Aiden
Aiden
Aiden
You didnt ask anything
What
Tell us why did we do this today
What is this
We did that so that Its a line plot and why we didnt just do a normal data thing where we write it because if we just did that then it would be like hard to read
Its easier to just let those two people that have 50 and the three that 54 12
Aiden this is what I think Im hearing you say
Can I have everyones eyes and ears this way please
When we have a long list of data like this its kind of hard to think about what it means and how much of each information we have
When we have our data represented in a line plot we can see the information clearly and its easy to understand
The line plots are easy to understand
We could look up here and say Wow the largest head size in ourSSis what
56
56 centimeters
How many kids in ourSShave a head size of 56 centimeters
Two
Two
Two

Now if we had just this list of information we have to skim it and scan it and think through it
The line plot helps us organize the data
I will be back tomorrow and we will do one more page to solidify our thinking about this okay
Ladies and gentlemen you may listen to Ms Millers next directions
You are going to put your journal away andT1is looking for the quietest
Whos going to get to line up
Could we all just line up at the same time
