Arina youre right here next to Eric
Haha
All right ladies and gentlemen open up to your first toolkit
We already started working on that
The focus right now with your partner is to work through those examples make sure you know how to do those
Were going to start with the first few minutes of getting that toolkit finished up
If you were not here
Do you guys have any pencil
This is available in the stand over there so that you can just paste it in
sit up
Alison do you mind turning that on
And Kinsley could you turn on the lamp in the back please
Im Piper
Hi
I asked him that before
Thank you
All right so youre focusing on the examples working with your partner
Coming up with a consensus
Do you know the right answer
Youre the only one without a partner
A who whatty
Whats the cubic root of 24
It used to be squared what happened
All right Sara Valentina
No
You know what Chase
I wasnt asking you was I
I was asking her
Diego
What do you
Yes theres two over there
One of them  the other ones for the second one
But is there a cubic root of 21
What are you doing
Why
I dont know
What are you trying to solve
I dont know
The real solution was
Yes we  good luck
Its probably easier if you just read them up there  because my handwriting sucks
Theres glue sticks up there
have answers already
All right
Wheres Byrons toolkit
Im trying to find it
You found cubic
You know we are two minutes in class right
I know I came in
A bit disheveled
Yes I  your class
The only math class
You got your answers
I think so
All right
Ms  can you help me with this problem
You know what you have an excellent source right here
He already has the answer
He was yelling at me
What
You just cant judge a book by its cover can you
Okay Chase can you please help me with this problem
Yes
See all you have to do is subtract five and add five
No this one this one
X  34  24
You didnt do that one did you
No I did
You did
Yes
What did you do
You just I dont know
I used to know
Oh I know how to do it
You do know how to do it
So what is it
Yes you just put the
All right for 1A what do you think the answer is for 1A
This
I heard a couple 3s that would be correct
How about the answer for 1B
Plus or minus two
I like that plus or minus part
Yes
Yes
Plus or minus two
How about 2A
Negative four
Woohoo
Negative four and 2B
765
Yes
Yes
Can you show how to solve that one Ms
All right
I didnt show any work with that guy
For this type of a problem weve got to get X equals right because thats what our answer looks like as in X equals
If Im going to get an X equals Ive got to move that three and that four
Which one am I going to move first the three or the four
Four
The four and how do I do that
You cubic it
Yes kind of that
There you go fourth root it
Were going to take the fourth root of both sides
This is a concept well talk a lot about today
What
You asked me for help
What does that equal
X
X
Remember that two is implied in this case
A square root and a square basically cancel each other out
When I have this problem down here so Ive got X  34  24
The first thing I need to do is to undo a four
Ill just take the fourth root because those two things Just those two things leave me with X  3
So the fourth root of this guy you know what that is
2213363839
Its a nasty thing
All right so lets think about this
How many times do I multiple two to get to 24
Four
Four times
No
2 x 2 is
Thats 64
Four
Four time two
Shes just saying 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 what do you get
Times two
Its 64 not 24
It is 24
Its not
Yes it is
Youre stupid
Wait no Im sorry
4 x 2
She said times two
Lets see
Lets do it this way make it easier
What two numbers multiplied is 24
16 x 2 is 32
12 and two
Okay two and 12 and what two numbers multiply to 12
Six and two
Six and two
Three and two
and what two numbers multiply
Three and two
Three and two
So if I factor 24 all the way out Ive got 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
Do I have any groups of four
No
Sad face
Thats why we do end up with kind of a nasty number but before we go there if I take an even root what do I have to remember
Plus and minus
The plus and minus thingy right
So plus or minus
When I go to subtract three from both sides I prefer to put that minus three in the front so that I dont think that its part of this guy and do 24  3 and get 21 and be totally wrong
Plus or minus four over the square root of 24
Ive got to put that in my calculator twice the plus version and the minus version
Hopefully you are now done with our first toolkit
All right so what were going to do is in your journal so page 109 of the journal theres a space for notes at the bottom of that page
You and your partner work out these six problems together there at the bottom of page 109 in your journal
Its just a blank space
It says notes
Yes
Yes
Im just finding a spot for you to dump
Thats 110
I didnt even know you 12 years ago
I was two 12 years ago
Youre only 14
Yes
you
I dont know how to do this
That first one lets just put X
I think its  One over negative
Because Im a girl
One over X
Its more than
six and 3X over negative  over 6
This little piece of paper from Thursday might help you out if youre stuck
If youre not sure what to do look at this little piece of paper our second toolkit that we started on Thursday last week
Yes I put it on the web page
On the outside
It is one yes
What happens if you do the negative exponent thing
You put one
It goes into a fraction
No look at that
I know this looks
Would you help me because I wasnt here on Tuesday
You know what
Im very sorry
you the answer
One over X the power of  Yes just 1X
Its just 1X  if you flip it it changes it
Dont know
Whats under that
Is that a negative sign
Wow
Thats crazy
Nobody asked for your opinion
4 X B to the seventh power
Are we talking this guy
Great
What about the negative
You just put it over
Did you grab one of those from over other there
No
Eric use this to help explain  what to do
got it right in front of her
No you should trust me
Dude literally look at this thing and then just copy it
All right
Its right there
No but I have it
Im an idiot
Yes a little bit
You look at the fraction and then
Just flip it
and then you flip it
If its negative
So X4 and then you just put 1X
Im not sure if thats right its
Yes theres really not too much  but get the
Next
How are you doing there
Is it just A B
Is it just the same thing as times one
Or six  one
Four
No thats different
Yes I think its  Thats just Y2
Where did you put number three though
Thats just
Oh my gosh
Is that to the power of one
Yes
All right answers are up there
If youre person number one in your team so like Sara and Eli and Decia survey your other team members and see is there any questions that they have on these six problems
Are there any questions you have for me
Yes
You just flip it
Its just B74
Yes but this was
Did you get your question and answer
Oh shit
Where does it say that
All of the answers
Yes
You can flip it and then you multiply the four down
Whats number two
Dude
Number two
3X  This is not what we have
I dont know how she gets these at all
I got
36
Alison any questions
No
No
Chase
I have a question on two and three
I have  two and three
Whyd she say my name
Two and three
All right so if you look
Lets pretend that you just asked for two and three
What
With these types of problems you have to be careful
What is the 6 on
The X
Just the X
Oh my God were stupid
If I wanted positive Ive got to flip it to the other side of the fraction
We dont see a fraction but its says if its over one and then were done
So once I flipped it I can change it from a negative six to a positive six and Im done
I dont understand
The problem is that every single one is a different formula which makes it really hard
Three its negative here
Put it up there and make it positive
negative
and its over one so I dont need that one so I got that
Then you just change it to
Memorize that real quick
Good luck Nathan
All right Chase
Any questions from your group
No
No
All right
We are the smart team
Paul
Youre good
How about Antonio
Questions with your group
They just couldnt see it that well
Just couldnt see it
So you helped them out
Eli any questions
No it was the same thing  answered
All right cool
You guys are good
Eric
You guys
All right
Were going to press on then
Were going to look at the homework
Both classes basically had the same average
Theirs was 925
Yours was 933 so yours was a little better
All right
In fact your lowest scoring problems were also a little bit higher percentage as theirs and different problems
These are the two problems that scored lowest in the other section
The idea here this is written in what kind of form
Rational unrational
Kind of
We say what do we have here
We have an
Exponent exponential
Exponent so we call it exponential form
If we switch it to a radical form what would I call it
Rational form
Rational
What would I put here
Three
Three
Three
Three
What do we call three
Whats the vocabulary
Cubic
Cubic
Yes it is a cubic but Im looking for generically
Cubed
what do we call the number right there
Index
All right what do we call this symbol
The radical
Radical
What do we call the number eight inside
Number eight
The radicand
Its got a D on the end so radicand
All right so this is how I could rewrite that
Where did our one go
Its the exponent on the outside
Its the exponent on the eight but we dont need that
We dont need to rewrite that
All right so can I rewrite eight as something to the power of three
No
Wait
Yes
Right
When we were talking over here about the square root of X2 is X I can start thinking that the cubed root of 23 is 2
Another way of thinking about and working through this one
Down here weve got a 27 thats to the 13
They said it was nine
All of that was squared but what should that be
Because is 9 X 9 X 9 27
No
No its 3 x 3 x 3 so thats where the error was in that one
Then over to the two that you guys had as the lowest scoring one
Person number three raise your hand
Not you
Youre two
All right talk your team through this problem
Turn around talk with your team
How do you solve this problem
This may have been one of the ones I
You subtract 40 from both sides and you get X  15
Thats five
No three
Its 247
I did that in my head
Negative 24
I dont know
This one was actually really easy
I dont know why
I had a time out for a reason
Is that a
No its just my jacket
I considered it
Dude lets go
Who was that
You couldnt even see that
John theres a
What flavor is that
All right
Was this the strategy
Thats complete ass
That is so bad
She asks hoping that this is the strategy
Thats what I did
Yes
Then of course up here where it says to round to two decimal places
That says theyre not interested in the exact answer
Theyre interested in can I plug it into the calculator and get a final answer
When you see this kind of thing you know that youve got to be using the calculator for that
All right error analysis here
Over here on the left side I have 256 to the 43
If Im going to rewrite that as a radical form from exponential to radical what do I put here
Whats the index
Three
Three
Its the denominator of that
Then what goes in here
256 and whats the exponent that goes on that
Four
Thats how I would rewrite that
They made the mistake here and they put it the other way around
X where that mistake was
Great any questions on those four
Yes sir
Wait never mind
I know its a little hard to read
Its kind of small there
All right then
Lets open up our journal to page 112
Journal 112
Person number two of the team
Person number two
Thats me
Just read this essential question to your teammates
How can you use properties of  products and potions
Because if you know the properties
Im hoping youre catching on to this vocabulary
If you think youve got it and youre never going to forget it good to go
If not you might want to add that to your toolkit since youve got your toolkit sitting there you might want to just kind of get that vocabulary down
Also a reminder when we talk about products were specifically talking about
Quotient means
Dont get confused on that
We are going to do all three of the explorations
Now those explorations particularly the first one youre going to find that your tool kit from last week is going to be very helpful for you because notice all the property names are here
Youve got to identify you got to match those things together but youre also completing what goes in the blank
If I have a to the power of negative two that equals one over a
Squared
Squared right
I can think about this guy as if its a fraction and if I flip the A to the other side I can write my A as being positive but remember its supposed to be in the denominator so weve got to have the one on top of it
Which property did I just use
Negative
Negative exponents
I match that guy up with that one
My answer for A is one over A squared D Just identifying which property I just use
You might want to use that little piece of paper that you got last Thursday and match those up
When you and your partner agree let me know and Ill start showing the answers
I dont have a pencil
As long as youve multiplied both
Would it be
Is this the bad one
thats a banana
Fuck you why did you give to her
Youre not supposed to know
Yes you do
You just want
It tastes like crap
It tastes like absolute shit
Whatd they lie
that stick catch you
Go all the way down
Youre so bad at this
I could
Ive done it before
How
With my hand
thing
Yes the mature thing
Yes youre
I actually  we were going to try
Do you even know how to light a match
Youre doing it all wrong
I dont know dude
Normally  use like that but I can get on my hand
hold your finger on top of it
go
Yes like that
No
Hold it
You hold like that you just
Yes but like you hold it on top of the green thing
is going really fast
Ill do it on my nail
Thats not going to work at all
Wow youre a much better friend than I am
I dont know dude
Youre working on explorations one two three work through them all
Whats with them and their bananas
That one was pineapple banana
Thats disgusting
you only do the exponent
do it right
Yes
Yes
Did you ask Cole first
What is this exactly you are doing here
Like are you
Were simplifying in this case the product
What can I do to simplify that
So 25
Will you marry me
Yes
Like that
Well will that get it into two thirds more simple
Not really
Not really
Now sometimes we got to get more complex before we get simple
How can I rewrite this a little simpler
Oh from here I just square
With the Jbone
Okay thats fine
John
The kids having my last name
What was that like
Like x  x gives us 2x  this is totally fine too
If I find those two that
Im not your wife either or your girlfriend
Im your friend
Not even your friend Im like your acquintance
We see the square of the square we know thats three two
Yes thats why when I  not your kid
Im not kidding its not your kid
The answers for exploration one and two are on the board just to make you can check your own track
I dont care
Not really
Im not crying
Two is our
Im crying
Oh my God
We already did and I filled out the first two
Thats so mean John
That was like
Alvin is a whole lot further along
How did that happen
Because I have stuck on this one
She just
Do you know Im not a bad strategy
All right so I dont have
How could I rewrite that
If I ignore the  and I just look at that how could I rewrite that
Thats not very helpful
No
Basically going from exponent idea to
If this is equal this would that mean that this is equal to this square root of  36 would be six
Sure okay so you do three in the denominator
Because if you try to square square root  its too hard
What if I have squared x squared to the third what does that mean to you
I mean do you have any better ideas
No
No not  because I dont have a fraction  to the what power
15
Right what did I do
Whats the cubic root of  25 is five
Now I have  two thirds and then it leads to theWhat happened then I do four
27 x 5 is  the fourth power
Whats my final answer
No
Which is
Two
Three
that just  six
Yes its three
No thats
Okay for this one would you do the 98 divided by two
You know we had a couple of different
We do 98 divided by 30 and then you find
I dont know where
What do you think are some options
That ones hard
Its just the same thing isnt it
No but the number is like 000
Wow okay
Isnt that hard
Maybe you find
It may be 1024
You guys are done
Alright
Could you do the square of four times the square of three because you also square the whole
Alright
Answers to explorations two and three are on the board
You want to make sure you know how you get those answers how do you get those answers
Four to the fifth power is 64
No its not
One over the 10th power is 4
Youve had a couple of options
One is  we could rewrite this as five to the one third power
You have that option
Then if you hit the math and option
Draw the person in the hand
I got an idea I dont know
All right if you and your partner feel like youre ready to take a quiz on this and youd have 100 then you could take a break and go in the hall by the window
I want to make sure you know how to do it
Dont leave the room unless you know how to do them
Now we need to think about what would be the fourth root of 256
Right  Whats the four three two one
That was the easy part
Does that work
Does 4 x 4 x 4 x 4 equals 236
Yes
Okay
All right if youre in here you better be having a conversation with somebody around you or youre going to talk with me
What do you need to know how to do
I dont even know whats the
This
Oh
How would you find  would find the cube
Probably going to put it in your calculator to find out what it is
You can use calculators on the quiz
Yes
Yes
But if you have to show your work you got to show how youre applying the different properties to get to that so kind of the idea of being able to write something like this where Im taking the square root of something squared  so if I can rewrite those numbers with that concept in mind Ill be good
Anybody in here got questions
Walk up there if you need
All right guys lets come back in
Come on in
So what it basically means  Thank you Melody
Thank you
All right were in the textbook on page 200
Were not taking a quiz today
Yes but were always rich
All right page 200
Theres a heater right next to you if you want to turn it on
All right page 200
Now none of these properties are very sophisticated they just get more complex when we have to pay attention to two and three and 10 different properties to solve
There might be different approaches
A lot of times theres not just one way of solving these particular problems
There is one right answer but theres not necessarily just one way of getting to that answer
We have to start to recognize what are some smart things to do
For example in this first one the base is seven
When my base is the same what can I do to those exponents that gets me to my answer a little bit quicker
All right
Its about knowing which of these properties is going to move me to the type of answer that I need to find
Here if I have power to a power what do I do with the powers
Multiply
Power to a power I multiply them
Then here I have two different bases so I cant do any combining since I have a six and a four
The only thing to happen at this step is we just lost the one
We didnt need to have the one there
All right
Dont get confused just because youve got something like this doesnt mean now were going to have it be 1 and 23 as the exponent but then which base would we choose or what would we do
Just recognize most of these properties or if I have the same base
All right
I have the same base as seven here but I dont have the same base here
All right then over here Im multiplying and Ive got powers to a power and its a negative guy
Notice what happened
Since my bases are different but I have a common exponent thats the first step that was first taken and I still have my negative 15
Now what happened here
We went ahead and multiplied the 4 X 3 because this 5 is outside of the 4 X 3 so I can multiply the 4 X 3 and then since I have a power to a power I can multiply those which just equals 1 and so I end up here
Right because Ive got to flip it over to the other side of the fraction bar
Now a lot of times Ill see students thatll kind of forget that that one is left behind
Remember that any time youre doing this and youre flipping it into the denominator whats left in the numerator is a one
All right lets look then at D I have a fraction with a common base and all they did in that first step was identify that theres that implied one on the five
What do I do when I have common bases and Im dividing when I have a quotient
You subtract
I subtract them
Weve got to know when do I add
When do I multiply
So that we do the right thing
When do I subtract and I end up with 5
Then down here Im looking for step that makes sense and I notice that my exponents are the same so I can move that exponent outside of the parenthesis with still the power to a power here
Power to a power but look at what I can do first
Ive got a nice number there
426 will give me seven
My 13 to the 12
Ive got power to a power so I multiply those so I end up with 7 and 23
Its about starting to be able to see what is the thing thats in common that I could use
In this case we have a common base
Sometimes we had a common exponent that we could use
Its just going to take practice of doing these to really start to grasp hold of them
All right so any questions from anybody that were left with any of those examples
All right lets go to example two so thats on the next page
Example two is talking about using properties of radicals which is what this guide is
I gave you this as well last Thursday
If Im multiplying inside of a radical I can split it up
Or if Im multiplying two radicals I can go the other way and combine them
We have the one that was square root of three times the square root of twelve
Yes it was the square root
So we could multiply the 3 X 12 and take the square root of 36 and come up with six
Same property
Multiplication and division you know typically they go handinhand so I can do that same sort of thing
I can a radical a root of a fraction and split it into two radicals or go the other direction as long as my roots are still the same
Looking at the examples theres two examples here
The 12 and the 18 can be combined so that Im taking the cube root of 216 which is a nice whole number
So 63 equals
Whats 23
Eight
33
43
53
73
Something something
Wait wait
49 x 7
Grab your calculator
Whats 73 going to be
Say it again
All right
83
93
All right
Since we are going to be working with a lot of cubes I would suggest that you write that into your toolkit so that you can start recognizing those numbers
Certainly eight 27 64 probably 125
Those are probably easy for us to grab a hold of
Let me give you a couple of minutes
Write those down in that second toolkit that were Weve been working with
Just so that we kind of start to recognize perfect cubes because wouldnt it be nice to just know that especially if you didnt have a calculator
Now if I didnt have a calculator here Id look at 216 and Id go Well I know its divisible by two
Then 108 divisible by two and keep going but it sure would be nice if Id recognized that 216 was a perfect cube
Got a question
Do you know if were going to be able to use calculators
I think its going to end up that we have sections that are with calculator and sections without
I havent seen the test yet so I dont know how its breaking out but thats really the thought
Yes
Yes
the Friday before spring break
No it will be two Fridays
Thatll be the second Friday of February
Lets see
Im sorry
March
The second Friday of March is the 13th
Friday the 13th
Okay so that means that were going to be after
Correct
We have the end of the third quarter another year of school which is basically
Yes the 13th
Its always a good idea to keep your multiplechoice section  since the final is going to be easier and the midterm is going to be harder
I do have them right here
Theyre graded
I havent gotten into the grade books yet
Probably I might be giving them back tomorrow
Yes
Yes
This quarter
Yes this quarter
Of course a lot of it builds
All right
Ladies and gentlemen hopefully youve got those perfect cubes
Lets look at example B here
Wed looked at the one that had multiplication
This is the one with division
The quotient property here if I notice that theyre both fourth roots I can combine them
Lo and behold 80 5 is a nice number and  16 gives me 2
Now this is an important little guy right here
Lets have the hallway partner read this and then the window partner then the hallway then the window then the hallway
Just alternate through
Read each of these lines here
You dont need one of this
No
All right
All right
What you just read those three bullets there are also on this piece of paper
Youll notice theres three bullets
They look just like those three up there
Youre going to see this type of prompt a lot
Put this expression in simplest form
No radicands have perfect nth powers of factors other than one
What does that mean
Radicand would be whats under the radical
Thats the radicand
In this case that would not be the simplest from because there is a squared power thats a factor of eight
How could I rewrite eight
2x4
The 4 is 22
My  8 has an nth power as a factor
It has a square power
Thats what this one means
If Im taking a square root then something inside in here is going to be squared
This would not be my final answer
I would have to take it one more step
These two cancel each other out and my final answer in this case would be here
The next one
No radicand contains fractions
I cant have  38
Theres a fraction in there over two square roots of two
No radicals appear in the denominator
An answer like 1 3 is not acceptable
You cannot have a radical in the denominator position
How would you
Thank you very much once again
Thats called rationalizing the denominator right there
Look at the bold title here
It says Rationalizing the Denominator
That example is actually the same as example B in the textbook
Let me walk through how to do that
First what Ive just drawn a box around what does that equal
Four
Four
One
One
One
One
One
Ive got the same thing in the numerator and the same thing in the denominator so it equals one
If I take a number and multiply it by one have I changed that number
No
No
No
What if I multiply it by 10 over 10
Have I changed the number
No
No its a different form but the value hasnt changed
Its the same value
Its just a different form of it
I can multiply anything times one and I havent changed it
I just changed the form of it so that I can get rid of a radical
Then the question is in this particular case why was this what was chosen to be the form of one that I used
Notice I ended up without a radical in the denominator when I did this and that was the goal
What root am I taking here
How can I rewrite A
A is two to the what power
I need two more so that when I take the fifth root of it Ive got the fifth root of two to the fifth which will just equal to two
Looking back this is what were starting with
Thats my prompt
I look at it well I do have a root in common but seven eighths is never going to reduce so I need to do something different
Notice that I just rewritten it here and Im trying to figure out what form of one am I going to use
This guy right here is the fifth root of two to the fifth
2x2x2x2x2 will equal the 32 over here
I like this because that gives me the two and I no longer have a radical on the denominator
Ive got two to the third Im taking a fifth root
I need two more twos
Thats what Im choosing to multiply this by
Whatever I decide needs to go here so that when I work with that I get something thats not a radical I then just copy it up here
This is always what Im picking and the other thing just goes up on top to make it a one
Thats whats called rationalizing the denominator and thats what that little slip of paper walks you through
Notice in the paper theres the green that shows this particular prop does have a radical in the denominator so weve got to get rid of that
Then the circle in blue is the form of one that were using to multiply it by
Any questions on that
Just this one
Its going to take some practice to get used to
Here is a different one example four
Example four the prompt once again its saying we need something in simplest form
I look at those three bullets so that I know what simplest form means
The one problem I have is that radical thats in the denominator so that  3 is a problem
Notice my form of one that Im choosing to multiply by simply changed the sign
What does that remind you of
The difference of two
Squares
We just had a test that talks about the difference of two squares
We were mostly going from this and factoring to this
Now were just doing the reverse because what happened
When I multiply those two binomials two terms here two terms here two binomials
When I multiply those two together what do I get
I get a 5 3 and when I multiply those two together I get a
What happens when I combine those two
They go away
Thats why we dont have three terms combining with those and having a term in the middle
Thats how we can use the difference of two squares
If in the denominator I have a radical where Im either adding or subtracting Im just going to change that middle sign for my form of one that I use
Then I have to go through this simplification process and Ill end up without a radical in the denominator
Whats  32 equal
Three
Three so 253 and thats where the 22 comes from
Two different examples there of how to rationalize the denominator
Questions on this one
Can we do another one
We will have some practice hopefully before you leave
When we move to the practice you can target in on that and start there
Adding and subtracting
Weve talked about multiplying and dividing radicals
Now were adding and subtracting
The only way I can combine these is because I have a common fourth root that Im taking
Im taking  10
I have one of them here and I have seven of them here that means I have eight of these
In other words I can think about this as if its x 7x and I have 8xs
Only now my x is actually the fourth root
Then here its in exponent form but Ive got 2 of them here and Im adding 10 more so Ive got a total of 12 of them
Its nothing more than 2x10x
Here its a little bit different
Right here theres not an obvious combination like I saw here but I can rewrite this guy as 27x2
We saw that 27 is one of our perfect cubes so the 3 comes out and Im then left with 3 square roots of 2 as a common element
I may have to modify something here before I see that I have some like terms that I can combine
Again this is like 3x1x and so the 31 is there
Pretty much like Eli was asking it takes practice on this
When we get to example six theres not really anything new
Oh actually there is a little something new
Ill have to explain this
When were working with radicals if were taking an odd root a cube root a fifth root seventh root that thing I dont have to worry about any particular change that the even one is calling for
In other words when Im taking an even root square root fourth root and so on my answer Im going to specify as being a positive value
For example if Im taking the  3 to the 4th my answer is the positive answer
Thats one little tricky part to come into play and in this example right here where Im picking an even root I split my fraction rewrite this as something to the fourth power
Instead of writing y to the eighth Im looking for how can I rewrite that as something to a fourth power so that I know what I can factor out and notice what happens in the numerator there
All of these examples are here
Example seven and eight are just combination packages here so having to apply more than one thing
What were going to do for this last half hour is go back into the journal and were going to the extra practice
While we want to finish all of the extra practice thats in the journal if theres certain types of problems you want to start with dont feel like you have to start on problem number one
Youre looking for fourpoint two the extra practice and anybody got the page number yet
One sixteen
One sixteen did you say
One thirteen
Fifteen
Fifteen
All right it starts in the middle of page 115
Page 115 so thats how were going to finish our class with these extra practices
I will have the answer key on the board
Okay so  over 384
How can you
We need to factor 384
Did you get the final factoring of it
All right so 2x192 and 2x96 then 2x48
2x2x2 thats 8x2x3 right
8x6 can be 48
One two three four five six seven
I can write this its  of two to the seventh  three
Thats just a matter of factoring
You know you can get this far right
I just broke it up
I cant have a square root here but I know theres a relationship between three and nine
Im having the third root of 32
In order for this to get rid of the radical what would I have to multiply that by
Three because then thats going to give me 3 33 will end up 3 in the denominator
So Im rationalizing
Number five
Im going to just go  10x
Ms SaundersThe area of it would be
You have that extra practice test
Yes
Did you check your answers yet
Yes
Youve got to look at four to get so youll do
Can I do it
Itll be on my desk then
Okay thank you
Guys weve got the level four for you to do
Area
Perimeter
Perimeter
Yes you want to do that
Yes I just didnt distribute the four
I just got 40x
We need to get you to level four
You could do that too but you still get 40x
Yes but then wouldnt you have to multiply that to the 14 power
What happened here
Ivan you need to be working on your toolkit
Weve got three toolkits online
I printed this for the third one
Did you finish the extra practice
I thought we only had Just kidding were not done at 215
