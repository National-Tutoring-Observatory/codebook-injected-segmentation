So please read our target Christine
Dont step on that
All right Matteo please read R
I know  common denominator
Daniela next one
is also a common denominator
And finally Dean
Multiply the two original denominators and use their products as a common denominator
All right the lesson you guys did on Monday or Tuesday with Mrs Porter you did a really great job almost every single person got a three on the exit slip
That showed me you really understood finding equivalent fractions
Were going to be using that idea today to continue our work with finding common denominators
Im going to be teaching you several different ways to find common denominators were going to start with a little video to get you guys your brains into
Are those pies for the bake sale
I sure like pie
Please
Oh youre Dan and Jonah I want to know how to add and subtract fractions from Joshua
Pies are perfect for talking about fractions
As you can see this is one pie thats one part of one whole or one over one in fraction form
If I cut the pie right down the middle I get two pieces each piece is one divided by two or one half of the whole
One half plus one half equals two halves or one whole
In a fraction the numbers have names the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator
The denominator tells us how many pieces make up one whole the numerator tells us how many of those pieces were dealing with
The two in this case is a common denominator shared by both fractions
When you add fractions with the same denominator you add the numerators while the denominator stays the same
Each of these pieces is one divided by four or one fourth of the whole we can see that one fourth plus one fourth equals two fourths or one half
Lets say we want to add one fourth of this pie to one half of another one
Cutting pie one fourth and one half are fractions with different denominators
To add them we need to find their LCD or lowest common denominator
Its basically the lowest common multiple of the fractions denominators
For our denominators two and four that number is four we want to write all of our fractions as fractions of four
One fourth already is and as we saw before one half and two fourths are really the same thing
Now that we have a common denominator we can just add the numerators two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths
Subtraction is the same idea
As long as we have a common denominator its just a matter of subtracting the numerators
If we dont have a common denominator we find the lowest common denominator and rewrite our fractions to match
Heres a good example
Last year Jonahs pies were the highest selling items in the bake sale in fact five ninths of all the students in our school bought them but the year before only five twelfths of the school bought the pies
Come on it was the first year you made them people didnt know how good they were yet
Anyway to find out what fraction of students bought the pies the second year but not the first year we would subtract five twelfths from five ninths
The denominators are nine and 12 whats the LCD
Good 36
Thats the lowest number that both nine and 12 multiply into evenly
Lets rewrite our fractions as fractions of 36
Lets see to turn nine into 36 we need to multiply by four which means we also have to multiply the numerator by four and to turn 12 into 36 we multiply by three which means we can also multiply five by three
Now we can just subtract the numerators to get our answer between last year and the year before your sales increased by five 36ths
All these pies we cut up theyre going to go bad unless I eat them
Oh no this is your fault for making so many pies
I want you to take a moment to think please and I want you to think what is something I already knew from that video that it reminded me
And what is something new I learned from that video
And if you truly did not learn anything new then you can say two things you already knew
So think
ET high five Christine and Eloise then Pete right behind you two  is there anybody else
We will have one group of three Morgan why dont you be with Derek and then  why dont you just pop back here with Dean
All right go ahead and talk something new you learned something you already knew
Getting quiet means everyones shared
Callie pass this to Callie tell what your partner said she learned
Amaya said that she learned how you can multiply the denominators to get the same denominator
She didnt know how to do that
Okay
Pass the mic to Parker
Parker tell me something your partner already knew that the video reminded them of
My partner she already knew how to find the lowest common denominator
All right
Boys and girls were going to learn multiple ways to find your common denominator because in order to add fractions you need what
Think
In order to add them you need what
Morgan
LCD
Which means what
Lowest common denominator
You have to have a common denominator you cannot add fractions that do not have a common denominator
Thank you I briefly saw please pass that to Justin active listening thumb the only one I saw
Right now I want to review what you guys did a great job with on your exit slip
The first way is just listing equivalent fractions
I want you on your whiteboard to list the equivalent fractions for onethird and threefourths
List four equivalent fractions
T That one
Im going to give you about 30 more seconds Im looking around and even though you did awesome on the exit slip Im seeing some people who remember and some people who are struggling
If you are struggling feel free to ask somebody near you can you help me if you notice someone
My friends who are struggling this is literally no different than your exit slip which everyone did a super awesome job on
The difference and maybe this little clue will help you is that your exit slip was a chart that had numbers at the top remember those
Yes
Youre doing the same thing on your exit slip
Same exact thing even though I didnt put that chart there the skill is the same
Talk with your partner right now
How did you find your equivalent fractions how and does this remind you or help you based on that was your exit slip that you were successful on
Go
I agree with this can you explain to him how you did it
Who is partners here with Max
Are you I dont know why its doing that
Friend what you have here you dont even have the original fractions
You actually never turned in your exit slip either
Annabelle will you come and Annabelles partner
Hold up your whiteboard and explain your thinking so far and partner come with her
Front of the room
Show your whiteboard to the class so they know what to look at
We multiplied all numbers by first two and just multiplied by three and four and then five
My question is whats it
The fraction
What parts of the fraction
The numerator and the denominator
Thats really important theres a huge difference
Cap your markers place them put them down
Theres a huge difference between saying we multiplied it and I multiplied both the denominator and the numerator
If I am explaining that piece to a thirdgrader Pete and I say I multiply it are they going to understand what youre saying
No
We have to use our math vocabulary whats the math vocabulary I want to hear from you today
Numerator and denominator
Yes and
Common denominators
Common denominators thank you all take the mic back
A lot of people were stumped and putting that chart up helped it click but to find an equivalent fraction all youre doing is multiplying the numerator Hadley and the denominator by the same thing
You dont need a chart just know okay I can multiply it by two and get what
What fraction
If I multiply it by three think and when I point I want you to say the answer
Whats my next equivalent fraction multiplied by three
Three ninths
Multiplied by four
412
Max multiply it by five
Multiply the numerate and the denominator both by five what would my new fraction be
Start with the numerator one whats one times five
Now the denominator whats three times five
And whats my fraction
Yes exactly
All right take a look at your show me thumbs up if you have those some sideways if you had some wrong thumbs down if you are really confused
Now you should have done this in different colors
Three fourths same rule same thing to find equivalent fractions we do what
Who can raise their hand and share what do we need to do to find equivalent fractions
Liliana
I need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number
Yes nice active listening thumbs
If I multiply both by two what do I get
Six eighth
Three
Three
912
Four
Four
1216
Five
Five
1520
If Im looking to add these together and Im looking for the common denominator whats a synonym for common
Think
Tell your partner
Same
Tell me
Same
I want the denominator thats the same whats the denominator thats the same
Ivy I need your body whole body turned around facing
Thank you
Your whole body though not just the top part
Look at our numbers think show me a thumbs up when youre ready whats the common denominator going to be for these two factions
My friends who dont have the thumbs up its right up here you dont have to do any more thinking we already did the thinking you just need to look for the one that means common or whats that synonym
Same
Daria what is my common denominator going to be
The common denominator is going to be 12
Awesome sentence there Daria
I agree so if Im adding or subtracting these fractions 13 or 34s I would need to change them to 12 as their common denominator
This is a review from Tuesday
Hey show me thumbs up sideways down
How are you feeling on this
Okay if youre sideways thats okay
Im going to show you three other ways
When were adding and subtracting you get to choose which way makes the most sense to you
The second way of doing this is checking to see if one denominator is a multiple of the other
For example what if I have the fraction 23 and I need to add 515s
If you know your times tables you already see something
Share with your partner what you might notice from this
Five four three two and one
Put that back in the middle
Eloise what did you and your partner notice
That the denominators are the same
True I agree
Did anybody notice anything different
Parker
That if you multiply three times five you get 15 which is the common denominator and also five is a numerator for that
What Parker is saying is he noticed that three is a factor of 15
Factor means that I can multiply two numbers to get the answer of 15
This is something with fractions well do a lot
If you didnt notice that right away because maybe times tables arent your jam you can think and list the factors
What times what equals three
One
One time what
One times two
One times two is two
One times three
One times three okay
I can also list the factors for 15 so one times what equals 15
Okay does two times anything equal 15
No
What about three
Yes
Three times what
Five
What about four
No
Five
Five
Yes
Yes we already have it
Okay factors always come in pairs and in doing this you might notice hey threes a factor of both of them but that doesnt matter for this one
Yes factors doesnt matter for this one because we cant divide five divided by three so I chose four numbers
I could change it though
Here we go six
Now this is probably the most challenging way
This is probably the way that people arent going to choose to do or if other ways are easy you can try this way because it does not work for every single fraction
Im going to talk you through it but if you dont understand thats okay
Weve been multiplying
The same thing works with dividing
I could take 653 and six divided No thats not going to work either
See
I told you it doesnt work
That will work 1052
Now I can add 2323 to get my answer
Okay like I said this way here isnt helpful but if I notice that 3 is a multiple of 15 or a factor of 15 I can do 35 which is what were going to move on to with our next step
Finding the least common denominator
To do this we find the least common multiple
Lets see here let me think of some fractions
Somebody give me a pretty easy fraction
Lily
23
Okay
All right Im going to say 14 to find the least common denominator what we need to do is we need to list the multiples of three and the multiples of four
What are multiples
Those are just our times tables thinking 31 is
Three
32 is
Six
Now what
5 4 12 15 18
Okay Im going to stop there
Usually we can stop at four or five
All right lets do the same thing for four
Four
Four
8 12
Do you notice something
Yes
What do you notice
Share with your partner what do you notice
Lily what did you and your partner notice
That theres two 12ths
That theres two 12ths
Weve already hit our least common denominator and it is 12
I dont like doing a lot of extra work so Im not going to keep naming my multiples
As soon as I hit the same one I stop
Now I need to make my equivalent fraction
In order to do that I need to do what
Share with your partner
How do we make an equivalent fraction
Allie came up here and told us or it was Sophie
Sophie and Dean came up here and told us what do we need to do to make our equivalent fraction
Talk with your partner go
Amaya how do we find our common or how do we find an equivalent fraction
Whats it
Remember we corrected that with them
What specific math vocabulary do we need to use
Denominator
And
Numerator
By
Tilus do you want to help her out
Just remember the same number
Yes so what number are we going to multiply them by
Its really easy to find
I just count one two three four
Im multiplied by my 3 by 4 to get 12
Im going to multiply both of these by four
24
Eight
34
Okay now for four I did count
One two three
13
Three
43
12 and there we go
This is my favorite way
This is the way I like to do it
Yes
Yes
Yes
Does it work with every fraction
Works with every fraction
You might have to keep going for a while before you hit a common one but it will work with every single fraction
All right lets try on our whiteboards with our partner lets practice this one
Okay
Lets try the problem thank you
Lets try using this strategy of finding the least common denominator with the fractions of 15 and 34
Find the equivalent fractions with the common denominator
I want you to use the third method there
Work with your partner
I got it
Maria I saw a whiteboard on your desk Im not sure what happened to it
Lets use a whiteboard and not Thats just because we take notes on that
Do you need a marker
Is that the problem
What are you doing just snatching it from me
Come on man
What can we do if we dont have the resources we need
Whats the strategy
Okay so can I ask why you didnt ask
You know the strategy youve got to do it
I think you dont know that
Okay
Lets take a look at this
Four
Four
Between 12 and 15 is only three numbers not four
Okay Im going to give you about 30 more seconds
Okay
Just rub it for me
Okay
Thats fine
See how easy it is to ask and get our problem solved
Fingers crossed that one works
Yes
Yes
Yes
20 20 20
No its 2 20 20 20
Thats weird
Okay
See you very soon
Thats good
All right
Teyden and partner come on down and show us what it is that you did
Okay Daniela and Kayla would you mind cleaning that up so these boys can focus over here
Talk friend thats why I gave you the mic
Im dealing with multiples of five right now
get a common denominator of
Okay
Its confused because youre holding the pen and Maybe hand off the pen to your partner or something
Im  with that because theres a multiple I know theyre the same numbers
the denominator would be five
5
No 14  and then 3515
Okay what do you guys think
Derek how did you guys know to multiply 34 by 5
The numerator and the denominator by five
Think back to what strategy I used up there
What did I do
Who can remind Derek what I did
Derek phone a friend or if you know say
She looked at the multiples and she counted how many multiples into the common denominator
Okay so count for me Derek how many multiples for the 4 until you hit the 20
One two three four five
Yes thats how we need to multiply the numerator and denominator by five
Now class whats a resource Thank you boys
Whats a resource you can use if youre not super awesome with your times tables
What resource can you use to find them Molly
Find an
What part of it
The very end I think or beginning
It has what tool
Yes  multiplication table
Yes
Yes
Yes
That multiplication table literally has the multiples in a row
Super easy
Although you should know it without the multiplication table especially since youre about to become sixth graders
All right final one final strategy
This is a students favorite strategy because it takes the least amount of time
However its not always the best strategy especially moving into sixth grade when they will be expecting you sorry to reduce your fractions or use simplest form
This strategy can cause you extra work but it works
Somebody give me a fraction not a super complicated fraction
110
Okay I asked for it
All right I need another fraction thats a little more challenging than 110 but keep it under 12 as our denominator
Esther
46
Okay
The final strategy is called the quick common denominator
For this strategy I take my denominators and I multiply them
I do 106
This is my new common denominator
Its not the least one though always so I cant call it my least common denominator its just a common denominator
What do I need to multiply 10 by to get my equivalent fraction 110
What do I need to multiply 110 by
Gracie
Six
Yes because we multiplied 10 by 6 to get 60 right
Im going to multiply this by six the numerator by six and the denominator by six
16 is
Six
106 is
Okay
Im going to do the same thing for 46 except what do I need to multiply 46 by
Yes
Yes
Yes
The opposite
410 is
610 is
Now I have my fractions
4060 and 660
Heres the deal
If its not least common had we have done it out this way we would have stopped at 30 and we wouldnt have gone all the way up to 60 and that would have been the least common
But this works theres nothing wrong with it okay
Any questions
Yes sir
I dont get how they got 1520
All right do I have anybody who wants to come up and clearly show where the 1520 came from using maybe the strategy I used over there
Do you want me to do the whole problem or just that one part
Just that one part you asked for the 1520 right
Yes
Okay
Okay so what you do is you
Pass this to Luka
So  times five I mean well  times five which is 15
Then we found our denominator is 20 so we just
Okay
To clarify as well we found it because we already multiply that by five
So I want to make sure that were clear were always multiplying what
Two things the
Numerator and denominator
If you only do one of them its not equivalent okay
All right
In a moment Im going to ask you to return to your seats and Im going to ask you to look at page 156 in your math journals
For page 156 youre going to be working with your purple partner and youre going to be doing SageNScribe
get this to Hadley and Harley
I noticed that these two friends are taking notes even though I did not ask them to which I think is a great strategy
This will be up for you
Youre going to SageNScribe for numbers one through seven
You can decide who goes first I really dont care
Yes
Yes
Yes
If the Scribe thinks that the Sage isnt correct can they help
Absolutely
If the Scribe thinks the Sages wrong you can stop them give them a hint
Like you might say I noticed when I was walking around somebody put 15 for one of the factors of four
And I said Hey I noticed that 12 plus three is 15 not 12 plus four so that was my hint and then they figured out their mistake okay
So you absolutely can
If they totally dont get it help them as needed
Quick review with your partner currently whats SageNScribe
Whats my expectations
All right
Five four three two and one so on your math journal I should only see every other problem
So if youre Scribe for number one I would see writing for one three five and seven
If youre Scribe for number two Id see writing for two four and six
If you have writing for every single one of them youre not doing this right and youre going to get a fine okay
So lets head back
Purple
Purple yes purple partner
And friends who are sitting right by me theres a pencil
Theres a mechanical pencil
Can we get snacks
Yes you may eat snacks now
My expectation is that you are working in 10 seconds
Yes 156 to 157
Were starting with number one
Some of you are starting at the top of the page
Thats not number one
So whos my purple  You two
either Eloise or you guys need to Ivy I could not tell at all you were Eloises partner because you were facing away from her
Can you turn your whole body to face towards her
Then whos going to go first
Okay so that means youre telling her what to do
For number one A is already done for us
So now you need to use that information to do B
Weve already found the  fractions here so were adding and what would the answer will be
Pardon
So where is the 18 coming from
Like maybe on your whiteboard its like
When she says 18 do you understand where youre supposed to write the 18
Listen to the difference
I agree but I would say instead Ivy I would say the denominator is 18
Do you know what to write if I say that
Okay write it or here upon B
So the denominator is 18
Perfect now she knows exactly
Now what can you
Here are your fractions already done for you
Were adding so now were going to have the
Brooke you already did the denominator
The numerator is
Just a little reminder to help these ladies out with the vocabulary
So whats the numerator
Help her specifically just like I told you
Now you need to do it for this one but pay attention to the order because the order has switched
So when youre looking at these the order has switched
Five four three two one
Whats this number called in a fraction
Numerator
Not a mumerator a numerator
Whats the bottom one called
Denominator
When you are talking to your Scribe you need to be specific okay
Also I caution you very much with the subtraction problem pay attention to the order
I also want to see all work on the page
For example if I have to find number one all the hard work is done for you as an example you already have your new fractions
You dont have to do any other work
But number two you do
You might say something like  Write a four  Now write the multiples of four
Four eight
12 16 20
Then whats the other number
We re on number two
Number two
No whats the other denominator
So then I might tell my person  Write a 12 write an equal sign
Now write the multiples of 12
Do I need to keep going
No
No so I might tell my partner to stop because you already found your common multiple
So youre specifically telling them each and every step okay
The other thing I noticed for number one is even though it has the answer for you you might want your Scribe to write
So you might say what is it 56 minus 29
Whats the equivalent fraction for 56
1518
I might say  Write 1518 minus  whats the other fraction
418
418 because this is showing your work right
Yes
Then I might say 15 minus four equals
The denominator stays the same so it is 18
I want to see you writing out the new problems with the common denominator okay
Keep working
Okay friends youve had several minutes to work and already worked with a whole partner group on number one and
So whos the Scribe for the first one
Whos the Scribe for number one
That should have already been decided
You guys have had like five minutes to work already
So youre the Sage then if youre talking and he s the Scribe
Callie I like how you got up to work and help her
Hey good job
You tricked me
Actually for some reason I was  my head because I thought
All right
Okay thank you
I ll fix them
Now you keep talking
I gave you a ton of hints for yours Ivy
Its up on the board what you need to tell her
That should be finished so she can move on and tell you
If Im being a Sage and I notice what shes doing Well first of all you told her four times two and one times two
But Im confused thats why Im multiplying one times two
Because if I do one times two I have to do two times two and that only gets me a denominator of four not 14
So if Im going to be for Sage Id start just with this fraction and Id say multiply the numerator of four times two and put that as your new numerator
All right keep going guys
Good job
Multiply the numerator four times two
So right here next to it write times two
Youre making yourself do more work than you need to because its already there
Now that makes my new numerator so make a new fraction right here with your new numerator as eight
It s my numerator so if I look at my work up here  is the numerator on the top of the fraction or in the bottom
The top
You want to put it when you write it on the top okay
Now Im going to do my denominator seven times two
Well you cant write 14
I didn t tell you to write 14
I told you to write seven times two
Now seven times two equals 14 thats my new denominator
Okay so my question is why are your fractions crazy wonky like that
You want your fractions to look like this okay
I know but youve got to then tilt your book differently so it comes out straight
Did you hear how I told her that
So you coach her for the next one okay
Hold on sir
I have a question class
What have you found frustrating
What have you found frustrating about the SageNScribe Eloise
My partner not telling me exactly where to put the numbers
Show me thumbs up if you found that frustrating
Okay anything else found frustrating
I heard someone say Not knowing what to say not knowing how to describe it
Anybody else found that frustrating
Yes I see that
Ive seen that coming through both of those things people not being specific and people really struggling at what to say
So if you havent struggled at what to say that probably shows you have a clear understanding of it
Remember I said I wanted to work on your board on there
What Im going to do now because Im going to switch from SageNScribe to just working together to solve at least two more problems
I look at our time were going way over our math time and we need to wrap it up and you doing SageNScribe is making it go a little longer
So if you and your partner want to continue SageNScribe go for it if youve got a jam and youre doing good otherwise I want you to just work together to solve
Asking questions if you and your partner are stuck
Mr Michaels and I are here to walk around and help
Please use us because thats our job
So
No just from wherever youre at now just start working together
Good question
All right so were on number two right now
She already told you how to do this one
I was there when she told you how to do that one
I was totally there when she told you not to do that one
Well maybe she moved on to this one because this one she told you that denominator was 18 remember
And she told you the numerator was 19
You even wrote it
So numerator is 19 because were taking five plus 13 okay
Now this one you are subtracting
So now were working together though Ivy so you dont have to worry about the SageNScribe piece
What is it going to be if Im subtracting these two
And that one I have up on the board
See the 1518 minus 418 up on the board
So why dont you write that right here and write this
Derek and Daria I need to see you working not just sitting
Its not acceptable
We dont have time to waste
This 1518 came because 56 is the same as 1518
Then the second number
418 yes
Thats why we put them in that order
Okay so I disagree with what you wrote down
Thats not following our strategy so erase
The answer is already up there too
Then thats going to go right here
Derek
Okay then lets move okay
All right
The next one I also did the front work for you and
See the four and the 12 there
We already know that the common denominator is 12 because we did that work together
How Im I going to find the equivalent fractions for 34 what do I need to do
Can I see one of your whiteboards and markers
Aha there we go
So its is 24 to 30 how big of a jump is that
Ive got 34 I know I need a common denominator of 12
What do I need to do
Wait is that in right now
Multiply You do count
You can count up there
See where it says the multiples of four Ivy
How many over is 12 if I count
More than two
The four would be one the eight would be two the 12 would be what
Three
Three
So I have to multiply always and this is where you made your mistake
The numerator and the denominator by three okay
So next to here multiply just like I did by three
So you write what I wrote here
Everyone is weird
If youre not weird then youre weird in a bad way
Now solve that
Whats the new fraction going to be
Notice how I wrote times three times three
I want you to write that times three times three
So that way if you get stuck later you can go back to this one and
What did you get  fraction
But thats not a fraction
Can you erase what you have please
Youre making a fraction of Good keep doing
Does this one need to change
Whats the denominator
Three times three equals what
Four times three equals what
This is my new fraction
This is what I need to write in that
Now this one already has the denominator of 12 so I just rewrite it
I dont have to change anything
Okay now were adding but were not adding that problem Okay Ill be there in a second
Were not adding this problem were adding our new numbers
Were adding these two numbers
So Im really going to be adding 912 plus whats the other one Ivy
But this is not 912 because it already has 12 so it has to stay the same
So its 712
Then I need you now to erase those answers because youre working ahead and youre not doing it correctly
I have 912 plus what
And you can write it right here right
Your new problem 912
So right here youre writing your new problem 912 plus  because it didnt change
Now what does that  You can write it there on the line
Its okay
and Hadley come here bring your stuff
Thank you
Well no
We multiply both of them by
Youve done everything Daria is only looking at you
You are about to get a fine
You need to work
If you need to join your group if you need to listen to me thats fine but
Okay so which one are you stuck on
Were working through
Are you stuck or is Hunter is stuck
Youre both stuck
Then join us and listen up
Can one of you tell what weve done so far
We already figured that out together
Were multiplying the three by three and the four by three because if I look up there Kayla Im speaking
The 12 is one two three numbers  okay
Thats why I multiplied them by three and got my new fraction
So see how  wrote it down here
Thats what I want you guys to do right now
All right so and if you have your problem now
Okay so the denominator never changes so its going to stay at 12
Your answer would be 16
Okay now rewrite
Same thing 34 is now 912 and the other one stayed the same
Yes stay the same
So now here youre just going to rewrite that problem with these new numbers and do the adding
can I ask what youre doing
Are you asking for help
Because youre literally going too fast
Just bring it to me because right now were doing math on something that it seems like we need some help with
Can you help me with this at least
Thank you
Okay so youve got to add the top
Good I agree
Now which one is bigger
Looking at the new fractions you cant compare without it so which one is actually bigger
Because thats not true
Look at these two 912 and 712 you have to compare the new fractions
So youre comparing I dont like writing with a marker
Can I borrow
Youre comparing remember the new fraction of 912 and 712
Which is bigger
Nine or seven
