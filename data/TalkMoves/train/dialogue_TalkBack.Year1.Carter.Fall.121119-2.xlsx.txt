Back to part two after weve reenergized our minds with snack
Lets look at a word that we will be using today
Alexis has taught us this word earlier this year
The word is addend
Everybody say that
Addend
Read the definition with me
A number which added to another
Thats what an addend is
A number which added to another
I dont know that I like the wording of that
Put it in your own words
This representation might help you to put it into your own words
Think about what that would be in your own words
Person B shares their thinking first
Ready go
Okay back to me
Thank you
Lets hear how you put this into your own words Brandon
Addend make a number which added to another is like saying you do a 01 plus 01 plus 01 or then if you want to do it with the colors like you can put the color under each one so you know which color you want if its not just 01 it could be like 02 and 01 so you will know which color is above which one
