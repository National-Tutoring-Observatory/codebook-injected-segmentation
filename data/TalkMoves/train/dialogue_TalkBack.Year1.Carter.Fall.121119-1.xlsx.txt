SS right thank you
Good to see you SS here ready to go
Lets please start with slate first today
Today Im going to read number riddles to you and youre going to write numbers on your slates
ActuSSy I decided Im not going to read the numbers were going to do it the showdown
Do you remember the structure showdown
Yes
Okay lets review it
Showdown is where a designated person will be the first captain and that person will read the riddle and everybody will write their idea on their slate and theyll turn it upside down on their desk to indicate to the captain that they are finished
Once the captain sees everybody is finished theyll say Showdown and youll share your slates and share your thinking then youll go to the next one and then it will be a different persons turn to be the showdown captain
Eloise
I dont know where my slate is
Yikes look in your desks see if you accidentSSy there we go
Thank you
Thanks for being brave enough to say something
Sometimes those things grow legs and leave during the night
Any other questions
I get what to do  I have questions
Gabriella
When can I be a showdown captain
Lets start with person four being the first showdown captain
Okay
Here we go
Showdown captain will read this to their teams
Here is your next one
Who is the showdown
Im in the hundredths place and it will work in the hundredths place
OkayAsher
Showdown
I just guessed so  two hundred and six because one third of six is two
How did you figure that out because some people dont know
I figured that out once because
Back to me please
Back to me please
Thank you
Rate how well you were able to answer these number riddles
Thank you
Lets look at our learning intention for today Read it with me
I can shade grids to represent and solve decimals and subtraction problems
I can shade grids to represent and solve decimal I think it should say addition
Yes decimal addition
Sorry I was having trouble with this slide today
Let me go back here to represent and solve decimal
See how its not letting me change that
Yes
I dont know why
I feel like there is another set of the textbox on here
Right but do you see that its not letting me modify this
I feel like Im in
Maybe the wrong type of font
Yes
There we go
I can shade grids to represent and solve decimal see there is two textboxes
Thats what Im doing
Decimal addition and subtraction problems there
Does that make sense now
No now we got too many ds
Adddition
Yes
Adddition
Addition
Now Im in the wrong textbox again
There we go
Life is good when thats your biggest problem right
There we go
Lets read the learning intention again
I can shade grids to represent and solve decimal addition and subtraction problems
You see an example there of addition problems
What do you notice about their shading
Share your observation with your face partner partner B goes first
Ready go
Back to me please
Back to me please
Thank you
Kayden what did you and your partner observe
That
What did you notice about the representations
That it shows which are subtracting and which are
Chase cSS on somebody to respond to you
Jack
I see that I expected to confuse that
For me my  was that they used multiple color to represent what they were doing
They would use green for 037 and then they use the blue for 015
How was your answer different from Kaydens answer
Kayden how was Jacks answer different than your answer
He was knowing what was showing what they were subtracting with
Still having some problem here
Looking closely Gabriella help him out
He was subtracting the numbers but he was adding the numbers
Yes look at the problems
Are we adding or subtracting there
Adding
Were adding
I like it when people show me rather than saying it that way
It gives people a chance to think
Both of these were examples of addition
Lets look at the learning and our success criteria
I will know Im successful when I can accurately shade the grids to represent the numbers to find the sums and differences
Stop and think about what that means
Tell your face partner what that first bullet means partner A goes first
Ready go
Make sure youre not shading more than the amount of boxes youre supposed to be shading and try
Back to me please
Back to me please
Fiona what does that first bullet mean
The first bullet means that  get it to work and then you can find there are so many differences from the grid and  decimals
Do you want to cSS on
Frankie
I think youre close to it
I think youre just a little close to it
What is it that youre not agreeing with
Im just not agreeing with that it
What would it mean to accurately shade the grids Brandon
It would mean make sure youre not shading more boxes than youre supposed to be shading so you get accurate amount the accurate answers of what youre
Okay so your grid would actuSSy show the two addends that were put together or the two numbers that youre using to subtract you can see how that subtraction works
The second one is being able to explain your representation
What does that mean to explain your representation
Talk with your face partner partner B explains
Ready go
Thank you
Santana what does it mean to explain your representation
To explain what you do
Thank you
Thats what were going to be striving for today
Lets go to our math message please
That is right here
Math Message look at the grid work with a partner to answer these questions
How much is shaded in blue
How much is shaded in red
How much is shaded in SS
Write an addition numbers sentence that represents the grid
This line is kind of a bummer because you missed the first question
Do you see how the first question is how much is shaded in blue
Can you remember that
Youre first going to answer how much is shaded in blue then you are going to keep going through the questions
Youre working with your partner shoulder partner
How did you get that
I thought because if you look at see this section is in a blue and these sections are each 10 and they each are both filled up and then I looked at these sections and there was five but I realized one of the section is filled SS the way and there is three left and 3 minus 10 is 7 so I got 47
47 reSSy quick
How did you know right way that it was 47
It was because there are four sections and they are SS filled with 10s and then there was another section that it was like a 10 it was five at the top then you realize it doesnt have the bottom filled up so its seven because its minus three its subtracting 3 from 10
I should use that strategy too
That was reSSy efficient wasnt it
I love your thinking
Im wondering why youre doing this as whole numbers rather than decimals
Oh sorry
No you dont need to apologize
I had a question for you so I was just curious why its almost a
SS right
Thank you
Can I have Gabriella get up and explain your thinking because I heard her explain it to Hanna in a reSSy efficient way you could do it
Thank you
What I did is got my answer as 67 I did that because when there is two blues there is two sections of blue and each section is 10
10 plus 10 is 20 then the decimal I got was zero and two tenth and then I realized there was five sections that were filled up but then I realized at the bottom one is not SS filled up and thats three not filled up
3 minus 10 is 7 and then there was
Can I interrupt you
Can you go up and show what youre talking about because I think some of us need to see what mean
I knew that these are each 10 and there are two blues so 10 plus 10 is 20 then if you  one two three four five of them but then I realized that there was three that arent filled up and 3 minus 10 is 7 and these are SS filled up and theres four of them that are filled up and thats 10 to 10 plus10 times four is 40 and then just add on the 7 its 47 and then I got zero and 47 hundredths then I did zero and 3 tenths plus zero and 47 hundredths equals zero and 67 hundredths
Give Hanna a round of applause
Nicely done
As I walk around the room I see people that just naturSSy wrote the number model that goes with that
If you didnt write the number sentence that would match whats shown on the grid can you do that please
Whats the number of sentence that matches this
Write down on your slate youre going to flash it to me
Flash
I see some people remembering that were talking about decimals and I see some people not remembering that
How do we know that were doing this as decimals
How do we know that this in decimal form
Kai
We know to do decimal point because first of SS it was talking about decimals and second of SS
Where was it talking about decimals
Where do you see that
Here in the groups
Its not here but where did we talk about decimals
In the learning intention
In the learning intention
Nice job Kai
Right in the learning intention thats saying that youre doing decimal addition and subtraction
Good
What else would help us recognize that this problem was in decimal form
It can be  not a decimal point but it can be
Somebody help her out
How do we know when we look at these that were talking about decimals besides our learning intention
Nice job with that one Kai
Eloise
Because its on the grid
You want to elaborate
Because decimals can be shown on the grid
We show decimals on our grid most of the time
Well we have been showing decimals on the grid
What is that whole square equal
Show me
What does that whole square equal
Weve been talking about it as one whole so that would mean each of those smSSer ones is a part of the whole
Were going to pause on our lesson here
Were going to have our snack and reload and then were coming back
Leave your stuff
