Well find a partner and check your answer talk with someone find another person check your answer talk with someone and then Ill be calling them to explain their thinking
You have a couple of times to solve independently
Check with someone talk with someone share strategies and then share out
All right
I havent taught a math fifthgrade lesson in quite a while so some things I do might be exactly like Ms Franklin does them
Some things I do might be a little different but we know thats okay
So if I do something and youre like Wait a minute
Maybe not really different maybe Im doing that for a reason but Ms Franklin you can also say Ms Travers sometimes we do this instead and thats totally fine
Do you usually start at your desks
Carpet
What do you do
Did you have homework to go over or not
we dont because we didnt have homework over break
Excellent
at our desks
Excellent
I will need you right now to have your whiteboard and marker and the other thing that you will need today do you have a math spiral
Yes
Great
Would you please take out a spiral
But you can take a couple of notes about that in your spiral
There is a strategy well learn today that will help you progress
Okay
whiteboards and markers
I just wanted you to have your spiral ready for when we need it
My friends our lesson today is five one new math journal round two of math for fifthgrade year
Heres what also is exciting
Unit five unit six unit seven and unit eight
Thats it your former math units in all of fifthgrade
is that right Ms Franklin
Yes
It is
Excellent
Thats exciting isnt it
Yes
I would like to hear all of our if you are wearing a long sleeve shirt right now you are going to read todays lesson objective
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a multiplication rule
Thats a lot of information
I want you to think about what that is saying right now
Think about it
Reread it
Think what is this asking us to do today
Is there someone whod be willing to share your own words
What is our learning objective today
What is this asking us to do today
Bobby are you willing to
Yes
Okay
Tell us
It is saying you find denominators and multiply them but we are not multiplying the denominator but multiplying fractions
Youre close
You found some keywords in there today
We are going to be using a multiplication rule to help us with common denominators
Does that make sense
Because when we have fractions and we are adding and subtracting were adding and subtracting fractions today that have unlike denominators
Is denominator top number or bottom number
Bottom
Bottom number
In our fraction were going to say denominator for the bottom number
Whats the name for the top number on the fraction
Say it
Say it
Numerator
Excellent
We already have that vocabulary
Okay
We will be adding and subtracting fractions today that have unlike denominators
success criteria
Yes
That is on the next slide
Okay
Now short sleeves youre reading success criteria
Are you ready
Okay
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
I know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions
We will use a multiplication rule to make equivalent fractions
Well use that strategy for adding and subtracting fractions
At the end of math today I do have a problem or two that I can have you do independently for Ms Franklin and I to check Do you have it today
Do you have what we worked on today
Lets start on our whiteboard
Ms Franklin how do I get to that reading math
you cant do that on this
There you go
Thank you
Grade five
Thank you
Yes
You got it
Talking to somebody
Five and one
Thank you
I dont remember somethings about
Where do you want to go
I would like for us to start our mental math
You cant slide
use a mouse
Okay
Friends our mental math today is warming up our brain
Your answer is going to be zero one half or one whole
You are going to estimate whether the sums and differences are closer to zero one half or one whole
Your answer right now will be zero one half or one whole
Theres our first thinking problem
If you have one half plus one eighth youre just estimating in your head
Picture those
Think about those
If youre adding those fraction parts together is your answer closer to zero one half or one whole
Starting with a half and were adding a little bit more
That might help you
All right
Youre going to show your answer to your face partner
Ready
Ready
Three
Three
Two
One
Show
Three two one zero voices fifthgraders
Thats one of my strategies youll hear
Youll hear me say Three two one and get to zero voices
Okay
So theres a couple of seconds to finish up your conversation
Gabe what you wrote isnt here
Will you share your thinking that I heard you talk about
I said one half because if you have one half thats equivalent to four eighths
If youre adding on another eighths that would be five eighths and one and five eighths is really close to four eighths and its one eighth away from a half and its three eighths away from the whole
If you have similar thinking to Gabe please stand up
All right
Touch down
Sit back down
If you had a different thinking from Gabe please stand up
Stay standing if youre willing to share
Go ahead
Will you remind me your name please
Im Jenny
Jenny
I said one whole because I know since youre estimating its like rounding and if you round youre always starting with one half so you would always have one half up
Since youre adding to one half you would round this up to one whole
Speaking of that Im seeing some hand signals
You have some hand signals going on Ms Franklin
Okay
So somebody is like
Jenny will you call on someone else to add on to what you were thinking
Virginia
I respectfully disagree because one half is a benchmark of zero one half and one whole
You already have one half  just a little bit more onto it
So youre having to round it up to one whole
Youre going to round it back onto one half because of the middle more
My friends very smart thinking and I love your reasoning
I love how all of you in here did some great thinking about that problem
Were going to do just a couple more
Erase your boards
Three fourths minus two thirds
Remember your answer is zero one half or one whole
We subtracted three fourths minus two thirds
Will the answer be closer to zero one half or one whole
Get some thinking ready in your brain because youre sharing with your face partner again
This time I want the person with the shortest hair to share first
Ready
Ready
Three two one show and share
Three two one zero voices
Thank you so much
Ive heard some great conversations up here again
Lets see
Would you be willing to share Julie
Its Julie right
Okay
Julie
We said that three fourths is almost a whole and so is two thirds
So if you are rounding it it would almost be a whole minus a whole which we thought would be whole zero
Stand up if you have similar thinking to Julie
Great
Touch down
Stand up if you have a different thinking
Stay standing if youre willing to share
All right
Now Ill see your hands signal for what you were thinking about Julie
She said closest to zero
Okay
Lets check our answer here
All right
Thank you all for sharing your thinking
All right
We are going to erase our boards and do one just a little bit more challenging
Ready
Ready
Remember we are saying is our answer closer to zero one half or one whole
We have ninetynine hundredths plus one tenth
Think about what
Will your answer be closer to zero one half
Excellent
Get ready with your face partner again
This time were all going to start sharing first
Three two one
Show and share
Three
Three
Two
One
Zero
All right
I heard some great conversation up here
Is this team bright
Great
Eliza would you be willing to share
Would you mind standing up and facing your classmates this way
There you go
Where should your eyes be
I just want someone in your class to share with
Thank you
I said it would be one because basically ninetynine one hundredths would be When you add one hundredth it would be 100 or one
When you have one tenth it would be just a little less than one hundredth than one
Stand up if you have similar thinking with Eliza
Stand up if you have a different thinking with Eliza
Okay
Touch down
Stand up if youre unsure
Eliza would you call on someone else to share their thinking
Julie
I want to on your thinking I agree with it but Im still a little bit confused because Im just a little bit confused on your answer or how you did it
Me and my partner converted the one tenth to hundreds and  ten hundredths and then 99 plus two was going to get you over a hundred
Thats over a whole which we decided will be closer to a whole
Both of you have strategies that the answer is closest to one whole but we have some different thinking about
Excellent
Thank you for sharing
All right my friends
If we look up here on the PA is closest to one whole
Thank you for your awesome thinking
You may erase your whiteboards
Were going to get on with todays lesson
Hopefully that got our brains nice and warmed up
Okay
Ms Franklin Im going to have to do some thinking and remembering about
What do you usually use resources
Here
This one
Yes
Got it
Then you see the  the lower left
I do
Excellent
Were on that message
Friends Im going to have you stand up please
Youre going to do your mathematics standing up and you just might need someone on your desks with some fraction pieces
You are going to solve three problems and then we are going to have some team talk about the problem
Okay
Math message
Whoa
Do you ever do that or do you usually read it out loud
Here we go
There we go
Lets turn it to about half of that
Ready
Ready
Okay
Following problems
You may use fraction circle pieces a number line or drawings to help
When you finish talk to a partner about which problem was easiest to solve and which was the most difficult
Be ready to discuss your reasoning
One three fifths plus one fifth equals blank
Two one half plus one fourth equals blank
Three one fourth plus one third equals blank
Hey I just want to remind you where because you also have in your math journal where in this math journal I bNoaheve is there a fraction number line that you have as a resource
Front or back flap
Can you check for me
Back
Because one resource instruction circles one resource that said is number line fraction circles number lines or drawings
There you go
Thank you so much
My friends you can look at your fraction number lines in the back flap of your math journal
Im going to give you about two minutes of quiet working time and I will be asking you to defend your answers with a picture a drawing using your number lines using your fraction pieces and then well have some talk time
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
We just want to start the independent thinking time
Okay
My friends Im sorry if I wasnt clear
I want you to do some thinking time quietly for just a couple of minutes and then well do some talking time
Okay
All right
Two minutes of independence
Thats by yourself thinking time writing time drawing time and then Ill leave you talking
If you find the fraction circle  lacking some pieces there are some extras
So if youre missing like blacks or greens
Im going to make this just a little bigger for you
Is that better
Yes
Those are your three problems
I see you that you had an answer
How would you prove
Thats lovely
Youre going to do all three
Im going to pause can I pull up your whiteboard just for a moment
Well this is one way you can be showing your thinking
If you look over here friends where he has all three of his problems separated on his whiteboard
See if you could remember your problems one two three or just divide your board into thirds
Does anybody have an extra set of fourths because there was a bag that we need to do today
All four of the fourths
What color
Theyre yellow
Yellow fourths
eight of them please so just one part please
Im going to need yellow for fractions of
Can you please show me on your fingers would zero minutes one minute or two minutes be enough time for you to show your thinking on all three problems
Okay
Were going to compromise
One minute
In just a couple of seconds  will be sharing number one with your shoulder partner
If you dont have a shoulder partner then youll just have a group of three for the time being
Okay
So would you please just share your thinking on number one the answer and how do you know or why do you think your answer is correct with your reasoning
Okay
Shoulder partner conversation
Go
Go
Just number one
Five four three two and one
I heard some really good conversation and I really liked one of the models that I saw one over here
Could you please turn your eyes and ears over here toward Robin
Robin would you stand up and show your whiteboard for us
Do you mind
Okay
Tell us how you did number one
If you dont mind holding your whiteboard up you can see how she drew it with two different colors
Tell us about your thinking Robin
First I split the circle into fifths and then I shaded in pink the three fifths and then I shaded it orange the one fifth too
Robin Im sorry to interrupt
We cant see anything that youre talking about
Thank you
Then I did an orange of one fifth so you could see thats two different numbers
I see how you have the pieces are the same size
Theyre all fifths
You have five pieces of equal fives
Right
So you shaded in three of them and then one of them and your total is
Four fifths
Stand up if you have similar thinking to Robin
Excellent
Pick up three claps
Please
All right
Touch down
The same conversation shoulder partner question number two
Go
Go
So what I did is I took one half and  a fourth  so then I drew it and I came up  and then I connected another one
Wow
Okay
One half plus one fourth
How many fourths make up a half
Two
Okay how many fourths make up that
Okay
Three two one and zero voices
All right
Ladies and gentlemen again I heard some great math conversation
Noah would you be willing to share because I saw a different strategy over here
I saw the number line strategy rather than the fraction pieces
Would you be willing to share
Can I have you guys please turn your eyes and ears this way over to Noah
I did a number line strategy and
Can I switch
Absolutely
Wheres that white remote
Here we go
Great idea
Thanks Ms Franklin
This is why team teaching is so awesome
There we go
What I did I did two number lines
One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way
So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer
Three fourths
Thats what you had
Sometimes when we stand up in front of everyone we dont always say exactly what we mean
I want you to hear a vocabulary word that I heard Noah say
He said he converted one half to
Three fourths
So that it is
An equivalent fraction
An equivalent fraction
Say Equivalent fraction
Equivalent fraction
What does that mean
What is an equivalent fraction mean
How did you know
Do you want to tell us a little bit more about that Noah
Can I show a gesture because some people are naturally  to that
Show me
Show me
Show me
Show me
I love it
But how do you know theyre equal
How do you know one half
If you have a number line youd see two fourths sits directly underneath one half so thats why you have an equal
If you look at your number line two fourths is equivalent
Its the exact same amount of space as one half
Good
that
like to add
add the root of the equivalent is equal
So thats not
I agree with you that the root of the equivalent is equal but how would you show it or prove it with math
Whats your math reasoning
Fraction pieces
Fraction pieces would be another way
Right
Excellent
did you want to add on
Oh I couldnt
Okay
Awesome
Great
My friends thank you so much
Give Noah three claps
All right
Last one were going to talk about is number three
Please talk with your shoulder partner again
Go
Go
You said
So 14 and 13 is looks like this
Yes thats
I knew
Three
Three
Two
One
Zero voices
I just love all about thinking in this classroom
I would like lets see
would you be willing to go up and show your drawing
His drawing represents fraction pieces
Would you be willing to do that
Then Kyle would you be willing to show your strategy you used because thats what todays lesson is all about
Would you be willing to show that next
Okay
All right
My friends would you please turn your chairs turn your body so that you can see the front screen
What I did is I knew this was 14 and this was 13 and what I did is I try to add these together and  and these two can go both into 12
So I added 14 and 13
So 14 is equivalent to 312 and because it was equivalent to 312 and then 13 was equivalent to 412 I did 312 plus 412 is 712
Stand up if you had similar thinking  Give  three claps
I want to show you a little bit of something else
If you were looking at the actual color fraction pieces these would be the colors and the pieces you would use 14 is the equivalent to one yellow piece 14 is equivalent to
312
312
Three green pieces 13 one orange piece is equivalent to
412
Now that they have common denominators then you can add the numerator
Correct
Now we have 312 plus 412 is 712
Did you want to add something
I saw your hand
Okay
I love when this happens when a student in the class sees the next math opportunity before we even teach it
I think some of you out there did that
I just happen to walk by Julie and I saw
She is going to show you what we call the multiplication rule for finding common denominators
This is something thats going to help you for the rest of math this whole year and your life
So take out your math spiral
I would write this in there
Were going to show that problem with the multiplication rule
Okay
Come on down Julie
My friends I want you to do is have your spiral next to you and your pencil ready to write down what were calling the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions
Okay
So if this was me and I was taking math notes right now I would write multiplication rule
You are not sure how shes going to put that
For finding equivalent fractions
Do you need this Ms Franklin
No
You can erase it if you want
Thank you
Yes
You got it
We are starting with 14 plus 13 is that right Julie
Mmhmm
A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third
So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this
It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before
So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent
So I did the same thing
You have to do the same thing
1  4  4 and then 1  3  3
So now it will be 412  312
Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators
So four plus three would be seven
That will be 712
Youre using the multiplication strategy to help you get common denominators
Uhhuh
The multiplication strategy gets you two equivalent fractions so that then you can add the numerators
Yes
For example like halves and fourths you know how many fourths are in halves
Thats what it is like
So thats what I did to
So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator
Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator
So if I multiply the denominator by the other denominator and then whatever you multiply the denominator by you also need to multiply the
Numerator
numerator by and thats how you can get an equivalent fraction
What Im hearing Julie say is were going to do 14  3
So Im going to rewrite that like this
14  4 times this denominator
We have 4  3  12 and 1  3 equals
Three
Three
Three
So what I know now is 14 is equivalent to 312
Okay
How would you do it this one
It is one
Then what would we do to 13
What would we multiply 13 times
Show her
You can do it on your
times say it Katie
One fourth
Times 44 which equals one
What would we get
Four twelves
Now I have a new problem 312  412 equals what
What did you guys get
712
Thats what we call the multiplication rule for finding equivalent fractions and well do a couple more before you do it on your own
Okay
Lets give Julie a round of applause
Thank you my dear
All right
So friends weve been sitting for a while
Its time for a mix and mingle
Okay
Its okay
Were going to take it step by step
Go ahead and take your math spiral and your pencil and stand up please
You know what
You know what
Im going to change my thinking because I think if we do a couple of the problems in the journal then we will be more on track
Your math spiral might help you but also grab your new math journal and please turn to Page 154
Ms Franklin that would be on my screen on practice on the factors
Math message
Just look into the second page
There we go
That was a good guess Mrs
Okay
My friends would you turn to this page 154
Its not weird the first page in your journal is 154
I always think thats funny when youre in the new version
No its 153
Its what
Its 153 the first one
No its 154
No its 153
Turn to Page 154 for me please
Okay
Here were going to try the multiplication rule for equivalent fractions
My friends youre seeing 12
Were going to use the multiplication rule to multiply
If we are multiplying the denominator by two youre going to multiply 1  2 is 2 and 2  4 is 4
You will have a new equivalent fraction
12 is equivalent to 24
Theres like a little saying I like to tell
Say it
Say it
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top
Everybody say it with me
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top
Say it with a Southern drawl
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top
Okay
Lets talk through how will we do 12  3
Can you write on this
Yes
You just have to erase with that blue  thats sitting on the corner of my desk
You want me to use this or the kit
I could use that
Yes
I just do
We would do 12  3
Talk me through it Kenley
You know what
You know what
Alice is here
Kenley is here
Alice Kenley Yes
Alice
You would do three times the denominator which is one or not the denominator the numerator which is one and 3  1 is three
Then you do the same thing to the denominator which is two
So then two times three is six
So then your new fraction is 36
What is 33 equivalent to
Show me
Show me
One whole
Are you making that number bigger by multiplying it by one
No
Youre renaming it
Sorry
I dont mean to step on you
No
I appreciate I think its so awesome to have two people teaching at the same time without thinking about much is it
Right
How about our five
12  5 what would that look like
I would say someone want to talk me through this one
Yes Eliza
Three times five it would be two times five would be 10 and then you would say
Well do one times five first which is inside
Were youre blue bag
Thank you my dear
I like the way I see people filling in their math drills as we go through these examples
Thank you
Okay
Because thats the numerator
Right
Which would be five and then two times five will be 10 which you would get 510
This would be
Five tenths
Now this is what Im seeing in the classroom
Teachers love this
Some kids are like Yes
Ive got this
Some kids are like I am stuck
So heres what were going to do
Okay
Were going to do mix and mingle for the two bits on the bottom
Okay
You have another fraction box and we are going to actually do it with our mix and mingle partner
Okay
So stand up with your math journal and your pencil please
Okay
You are right here now on this 25 box and youre going to mix
Go
Go
Mingle
Mingle
Mingle
Mingle
Mingle
Who thinks the timer is amazing
Ms Travers was really prepared
High five the person closest to you
If you dont have a partner walk toward the carpet please
If someone is walking towards the carpet invite them to join your group please and here we go
Would you please use equivalent fractions to find common denominators for 25
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Two times two is four
Two fifths
Friends lets do the two fifths the whole lot the two the three multiplied by the two the three and the five
Oh thats why they put the grey water up there
Miss Herd I figured out
Did you
Uhhuh
Down below
Uhhuh
Can we answer that
In just a minute
Are you ready to
Yes
and then Im going to say Go
Okay
All right
My friends wrap up your conversation with your partner
Stand and up and thank this partner
Thank you partner
Now were going to do another strategy thatTlikes a lot
Pairscompare
Join so that you have two with another two
So now you will have four pairscompare right now so youre having four together
Ready
Ready
Check your answers again with a new partnership
Go
Go
See if you have the same thing
I had 5  2
So its 410
Then 2  5 is 10
Ladies and gentlemen please thank your new partner and youre going to do one more mix and mingle
Go

High Five to the person closest to you but it needs to be someone you have not already been partners with today
So if youre with someone youve already been partners with you need to go find another partner please
Wave if you need someone
Awesome
Walk toward the carpet if you do need a partner and join another group
There we go
Okay
Freeze please
Your next question
Oh wait
So everybody has zero a voice for me
Your next question is this
What do you notice about the fractions in the gray shaded boxes
I want you to think first
What do you notice about the fractions in the gray shaded boxes
Talk to this partner about what you noticed and write down your thinking
Go
Go
What I noticed that they  tenths
Yes both of them  only 110
I think maybe it has to do with 5 and 2 because 5 times 2 is 10
It has to be
Thats something to do with multiplication rule
Yes
intention in line
What are we thinking about for our learning intention today
Because the multiplication
The second number we multiplied was both two times five like this
Theres the vocabulary from
All right
turn the screen back to todays learning and  Today were using equivalent fractions to finding common denominator to solve addition and subtraction fractions with unlike denominators using a
Multiplication rule
Okay
So what we are going to do is I want you to take another couple seconds to finish your thinking and jot down your answer
When I come back and check our thinking on
What do you notice about the fractions at the gray shaded boxes at our teams in just a moment
Okay
Think about it now
They were the same
Please thank this partner and head back to your seats
Thank you
Okay
Please bring your conversation to a close
I want to show you something I saw in most kids journals
I saw this but what Im really curious about is what you have written on your line
What do we notice about the factions in the gray shaded boxes
Faith will you share with us your thinking  please
I said that they are a common denominator and the denominator is the same
Also the numerator is 110 of the difference from
Thank you for starting us up
Would you call on someone else please
Me and my partner said is that  the denominator is 10 and the first one is 510 and the second one is 410 so theres a 110 difference too
Anything you would add with that Ms Franklin
I like their use of vocabulary
I sure do too the use of vocabulary
Now that we have that my friends thats going to help us with our next step is doing the actual adding and subtracting of fractions
Okay
Im going to flip back over here because sometimes I think it is helpful to just see how someone else worded it
They have common denominator of 10
25 is equivalent to 410
12 is equivalent to 510
Now that you have that my friends can you now that you have common denominators can we add
Yes
Lets do it
Ready
Ready
Lets do this
Pencils ready
I would like you to please solve number one A and B and C and then we will talk again
Go
Go
Think to yourself what is 12 equivalent to what is 25 equivalent to
Notice how to use the chart because youve already
Youve already done it
12 is equivalent to
Use the gray boxes
Hint
Hint
Use the two fractions in the gray boxes
Thats why theyre gray
this is 12 and 25 so here is 12 times
Yes
you did multiply  so there is 12 minus 25
My friends a couple of things I just noticed is remembering for us to think about what is 12 equal to
12 is equal to
510
510
We use the multiplication rule
This 12 is the same amount as 510 and then this 25 its the same amount as
410
410
This is what youre adding
You should not need your fraction toolkit
Youve got this
This is what you need
This is what you need right here
We already did the hard work up here in our chart
We know that 12 is equivalent to 510 and 25 is equivalent to 410
Now that we have that we can solve
510  410 fifth graders what is it
910
Answer right here is
910
Great
Now we do subtraction
Whats 12 equivalent
510
Whats 25 equivalent to
410
What is 510  410
110
Youre brilliant
We did the hard work up here
We did the multiplication rule up here in the chart
We use that information
After you have equivalent fractions then you can add and subtract
So my friends what is greater 12 or 25
12
Got it
If you are feNoahng likeTand Ms Franklin I am like I got this
I can keep going on my own
You will have about five minutes on your own
No because were going to the library so well have to come back and finish
If you are needing a help then well do about five minutes of some help time after
So stop and think right now
Oh sorry
this is you
No please
Finish
Reerase
I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions
How are you feNoahng about being able to do that at this point
We know you need more practice but how are you feNoahng right now
Well come back and finish practicing
All right
What do we say to Ms Travers
Thank you Ms Travers
Thank you for having me in your classroom today
