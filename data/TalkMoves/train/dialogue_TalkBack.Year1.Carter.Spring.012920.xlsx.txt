My friends have microphones on their tables theres a button that has a white circle
Can you please push that button so the green light comes on
Did the green light come on
Yes
You guys got yours on
Yes
You got yours on
Yes
You got yours on
Yes
Good
Ive also forgot  Thank you
Here we go
Hopefully that little mini lesson from your team mates will help you
Lets read this number
Now say it loud
586
Excellent
Please round this to the nearest whole number and flash
Way to go
If you said one you are correct
Way to go
Round to the nearest tenth
Flash
Good job
If you said six tenths you are correct
Way to go
Okay can you see that
Sorry I tried to move it up
Round this number now to the nearest hundredth please
Flash
Way to go
If you said 059 you are correct
If youre getting it incorrect ask yourself what youre doing incorrectly
Why dont you just read the right answer and evaluate Oh this is what I need to do differently
I know what to do
Im still confused
Fabulous
This is one of the things Im going to be picking up the pace on the slate because well lose to much time with this
Do you notice the pace of this
This is how it should be
Lets read this number in our hands to ourselves
Now let it out
39987
Way to go
Round this to the nearest whole number
Flash
Excellent
If you said 40 youre on the right track
Round this to the nearest tenths
Flash
Good
If you said 40 you are correct
This ones a little different than some of them so I want you to think why is it 40
Youre going to talk with your face partner
Partner B gets to go first
Ready
Go
Thank you
I get this now
Im still confused
Thank you
Round this number now to the nearest hundredth
Flash
Way to go
If you said 3999 you are correct
If I got every single one of these correct Im a four
If I got most of them correct Im a three
If I was making errors frequently I am a two
Show me how you did things
Thank you very much
Weve talked about the relevance if this multiple times so we should have this down
Why do we practice rounding
Antonio
I want to get better on it
Okay
Why do we want to get better at it is what I want you to think about
Everybody think
Why do we want to get better at this
Antonio
If you were doing a math problem youd want to know your answer is reasonable
What do you think of that thinking
Agreed
Agreed
Way to go
Lets look at our learning intention today
Read this aloud with me please
I can use area models to understand and apply an algorithm for fraction multiplication
Think for a minute
Area models we were making those
We definitely know what those are hopefully
An algorithm
If you dont remember that word see how its highlighted then at the bottom
Can you read that for us please
What does that say Colt
A set of step by step instructions to doing something such as carrying out  into a solution or solving a problem
Okay it seems people are agreeing
Algorithm that word shouldnt scare us
Weve talked about this word a couple of times this year
Its the process for finding a way to multiply fractions all right
Youre going to be looking at area models and finding out Oh I see how we can multiply fractions
Some of you have already being seeing that
Lets read the success criteria
Can you read this for us please Lyla
I will know when I couldnt do it when I can just successfully use the algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two through seven on page 179
Also I can explain how an area model shows one of my answers is correct
How many parts are there to this
Zane how many parts
Two
Exactly
Should you be doodling on your slate
No
Should you be talking with other people
No
Do you want to know how you know youre done your job
Yes
Yes
Thats why we go over this so you know what your job is to learn today
All right lets put up the math message please
Lets see what we can do here
Lets just take a copy and I guess I didnt realize that we needed a copy
I assumed this was going to be after a long project
Look on page 177
Lets see whats on that page
We already did that
Oh we did
Im still waiting to look at page 177 here
Thank you
Fabulous
Weve already done it
Its a page that has a blank one of these area models for you to fill out
Page 177
Youre working with a partner to look at 34 x 26
Thats the top part of the page there
Looks like some people havent done it
Some people have done it so if youve already done it youre going to interact with your partner all ready ready and some of us are going to do it right now
Thank you
We want to draw a rectangle that has an area equal to 34 x 23 what should the dimensions of our shaded rectangle be
Lyla
The dimensions for the shaded rectangle should be 1 x 1
Wait no
What are the dimensions of this rectangle
26 x 34
What do you guys think of that thinking
Thank you people are agreeing with that
I dont want to use that sorry I dont want to use that at this point
I want you to think this through
How could we mark the number lines to help us draw a rectangle thats 34 x 23 unit
How can we mark the number lines Zane
Looking at yours because its marked how can we mark the number lines so that we can make the dimensions of that
What do you guys say of his thinking
Hes saying it very uncertainly No why would you want to use the tick marks
So you dont have to count what the dimensions are you can just look where the shaded ends where to mark
See up here if you have those tick marks its really clear where to shade to isnt
Yes
Yes
Yes
Zane did you see the relevance of that
Yes
Okay because you seemed a little unsure the way you it so you labelled it what
Does that make sense now
Yes
All right
Weve already got them or drawn but you have to label the tick marks so what did you label this Xaxis this number line here
What were the tick marks labelled Harley
There were the Xaxis that were labeled 13
Thank you
What would the would the one whole potentially be labeled
44
44 thats the fraction component of that
What would the Yaxis the vertical axis be labeled
Thank you Harley
Haitus
There would be labeled 66
The whole axis
No the whole axis
The first tick mark would be
16 26 36 46 56 and 66 or one whole
There you go
Jorge I dont how this this built up do you see no one sharing the answers
Do you hear that
Do you hear how could you be fixing yours and adding those labels
Because as I walk around the room most people have it labelled
Way to go thank you
Now Im going to ask somebody throw their completed model under here and show how it demonstrates where that is 34 x 23
Lets have Titus
Thank you Titus
He is not to busy he has to come
Can you throw a number there so you can show us how your model demonstrates the product of 34 and 23
Thank you
I need you to speak up so we can actually hear you
My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is
Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24
This is  34 by 26 and that explains it
Elise what are you trying to say
Just a question to ask him
What would be the width of the shade
The width of the shade would be I think 34
I think a lot of us would say thats the length and then the width would be here
Would that change if you clip it
No
No it could look the same
Can you leave that up there real quick
You said something that was a great modeling for other students because I see some people counting each of those squares theyve count all the squares but you did something can you explain that part again real quick for everybody that didnt catch it
to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four
you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent
Thank you
Exactly its efficient because if you count on thats definitely work but thats more efficient
Nice job Titus a round of applause way to go
Thank you
Im going to have you do the problem number two make sure you read all the directions
When youre finished doing problem number two your job is to explain your thinking just the way you saw Titus explain his thinking all right
Questions
Thank you there you go
I see most students have already completed number two and youre sure of your thinking you can go on to number three and share your thinking
Remember the learning intention is to develop an algorithm
What would be the strategy to multiplying fraction where youre not making these area models
Area model proves your thinking but be looking for that pattern that algorithm you could  Thank you
Lets hear some conjectures about what you think the algorithm would be
What do you think the algorithm would be
Thats what you were talking about with your partners right
What do you think the algorithm is
Noelle
I think the algorithm is
Lets think back to the word algorithm
Its the process or the step
Was it going to be an answer to a computation problem
No
No its not
Itll get you that
It gets you that
Exactly
You were supposed to be talking with your partner
Looking at your work all the problems youve been doing whats the pattern youre seeing to getting these answers
Whats the pattern that you see
Youre looking at how to do this in an efficient way
Whats the pattern that you see Gray
The pattern I see is that when you see the multiplication problem like 56 x 14 you tend to do the numerator time the numerator like 5 x 1 but then do the denominator times the denominator 6 x 4 and then when you multiply the numerators you got the numerator of your answer and when you multiply the denominator you got the denominator of your answer which was 524
I love the way that you explained it
Its an algorithm
You multiply the numerators to get the new product
You multiply the denominators to get the denominator God bless you of the new product
Look at all your examples on those two pages
Do they follow that rule
Yes
Dont just say yes look
Analyze it
Does that rule work in each of those instances
Yes
Yes
Yes
Now I want you to write that algorithm
Turn the page to 178 please
See how it says in your own words describe the methods for multiplying fractions discovered in class
If you need some words spelled for you look up at the word bank
Numerator I know would be one
Whats another word that youd like spelled
Aspen
Denominator
Denominator
When we use this vocabulary it makes out explanation really clear
Whats another word that youd like
Algorithm
Algorithm
Thank you
Im just going to add the word common here
Do we need a common denominator here
Does that rule involve a common denominator
Look at the examples
Look at the one on the left
3 x 2  6
5 x 3  15
Do we need common denominator
No
Ive written it there for you but you dont need it
Colt
Multiply
Multiply
Aspen
Fraction
This word hasnt come up but Im guessing you might want it
Whats the answer to a multiplication problem called
Everybody say it
Product
In your own words explain that algorithm
Do you want to rehearse it with your partner first
You want to just say it first to your partner
Why dont you explain it to your shoulder partner
Make sure you both get a turn explaining it before you write
Ready
Go
We just came across another that we need to add
What is it  Factors
Because the two numbers are multiplying are factors
That will help your explanation be much more clear if you use that word
Thank you
When you have that rule written up stand up please
Thats what were saying whats the method for multiplying fractions
Im starting to see the same
I feel like then you should say Then multiply the denominators or
the denominator
Yes
Yes
Okay
This is what were writing right here so youve got to be  30 seconds
were talking about
Ms Carter I noticed that hers was precise but concise
Yes
Yes
She used math vocabulary and it was legible
She had everything I was looking for as a model
This is an exemplar
Go ahead and read that for us Dakota
The algorithm for multiplying fractions and fractions is first to multiply the numerator of the two factors
The answer to that will be the numerator of your product
Next you multiply both denominators to get the next part of your product
The only thing I guess I would let you multiply is both denominators to get the denominator of your the product
Its clear why youre multiplying because otherwise its not specific
I didnt notice that but nicely done
Very nicely done
Thank you
Ms Carter Lets see
Somebody else is like I think I have it
Cyrus
Thank you
Okay Cyrus
What I said is the algorithm of multiplying fractions is first you have to multiply both of the numerators to get the new numerator product then you have to multiply both denominators to get the new product then put both of the new products together
Love most of this
That second part gets a little shaky
Thats the part that I think were all going Eeek
The first part even the part where you explain how to get the numerator but then you get to the denominator see where it says multiply both denominators to get the new product the new what part of the product
The new denominator of the product and then when you said Then put them together you dont need that
You dont need that
You just explained
This is how you find the numerator and this is how you find the denominator thats your product
Very nicely done
Most of it is sounding great
Just make that small revision
Way to go
Thank you
Ms Carter Weve had two good models to do your fix ups
Check your work
Check your work
Modify your work based on the feedback you just got that you saw
Are we still doing area models
No
We are moving away from the area model
The area model was to prove to you that this works
Now thats youve seen the proof of that youre noticing the pattern so you should not be mentioning anything about area models
If you feel like youve got yours written clearly youve made revisions go ahead and work on that journal page 179  is multiply the numerators and youre multiplying numerators while combining
Numerators of the product
Then multiply the denominators we call them the denominator of the product okay
You just add those two parts  If you need a straight edge and you dont want to use a book or something theres templates that you could use
nice job
all the numerators  common denominator
No
and the answer was  Is 2 x 2 4
Is 3 x 3 9
Is 3 x 1 3
Is 4 x 4 16
Yes
Yes
thinking about what weve been talking about
Youll need to focus
Sitting there being quiet is not
1 x 3 is what
1 x 3 is 3
Good
Thats the numerator
2 x 6 is what
2 x 6 is 2 I mean 12
Thats your denominator
Whatever you do in the bottom you do to the top here
You need to find a common denominator
You act like you know what youre doing
thats why I got out templates
Yes
Straight edge it makes your work much more readable
Good looks like you know about applying algorithms
Way to go
Nice job
Good looks like you know how to apply algorithms
Way to go
Looks like you know how to apply the algorithm way to go
Where does this start
Because when you say then it implies that there was something before it
First you multiply both denominators with the denominator  I know youve got the numerator  because  the numerators together  the answer
You see that was the feedback supposed to be for sharing
Is that helpful does that matter
Im confused
According to this file the
to talk to you
Can we take a time out
First of all youre amazing
You get marbles because this is amazing hard work but I want you to raise eyes on me
Thank you
I want you to know
Ms Carter Just kidding
How do you know that your product is correct
We keep talking about rounding is rounding going to help us decide if our product is correct here
No
How are you going to know that your product is accurate
What would be a way to check this
Yes good
I love it
People in agreement
That is confusing
I love it
I want you to see if you can think of something so think tank
Can we talk about this on another day
It may have washed over you because new learning takes a while to secure itself
I want you to share your thinking at your teams
Share everybodys idea and honor somebody who doesnt have an idea thats fine too
Show your idea
How are you going to check originalness
Does anybody feel like Yes we came up with it
Dakota
My team was talking about you would take the denominator of your product and divide it by one of the denominators of the factors and then if you get the denominator of the other factor that you didnt divide your product denominator by you multiply the denominator and you would do the same thing for the numerators
That would work
I agree
Yes
Yes
That would work
I think theres a less complicated way but that would definitely work
Harley
If you were finding out half of 34 for example you would probably get  less than what youre finding of 34 and if you get something bigger your algorithm is not correct
Nice job
Can your product be bigger than either of the factors
No
Because youre finding a fraction of a fraction when youre multiplying
Your product has to be smaller than both than your factors
Nice job Harley
Way to use your math mind masterfully
Lets give her a round of applause
Ms Carter Keep going
Keep going
is 14 smaller than 13
Yes
Yes
Is it smaller than 34
Likely this is  Why do you feel like this is  These are two different fractions
This is a half times a half
Finding half of a half
It just didnt look right at first but now I can see
I think both of them are correct
Can they both  think about 12 3 x 4  12
2 x 6  12
As much as you think you dont need me you do because I give you some other things to think about
Thats how youre going to grow and Im going to grow right there next to you
My goal for you is to see as far you can get in three minutes and then you can check your work with your teams
All right
Youve gone as far as you could
You are checking work at your team so you should have checking material up
My friends that are writing with those cool erasable pen love love love them
That would be so me
I would love them but if you check your work using that same checking material is it clear to you
If you want to use a different cool cool erasable pen to check your work
Share your work compare answers share your thinking
Ready
Go
Lets go back to the first criteria and see how we did here
Whats that
Remind me when were done here to talk to you about math solutions
All right
Lets look at this learning intention
Zane can you read it orthe success criteria  for us
I will know I can do it when I can successfully use an algorithm to multiply the fractions and problems two to seven
Two through
two through seven on page 179
Also I can explain how the area model shows one of my answers is correct
People are feeling successful
Excellent nicely done
Please get a copy of the homework
Youll get your game on it
