Really quick I got to tell you how to do your assignment
Is that a hexagon
Yes an hexagon
Hexagon we finish this right
Yes
On your page in the math journal you need three colors and it talks about coloring
Where is the rest of this group
I dont know
Are they Mr C
Probably
Okay
Are you a hexagon
River is a hexagon
In your math journal can I see your math journal
Ill move all those things off your desk
In your math journal youll be doing two pages and one of the pages youre going to need a color right here
Youre going to do exactly what weve been working on
Use that page to help you and then here youre going to color and it says Shade each one a different color
So the 310s lets say Im going to do Are you guys
Looking because if youre not looking youre not going to have a clue
If Im doing 310s then Im going to color this like purple three long things
Then the next one is 100th Im going to color that one green and its a box a 100th is a box
Then the 1000th is a two so Im going to pick blue and Im going to color two ittybitty ones but they all have to be separate you cant color within another color
Then youre going to do what we did and then yes youre going to do the same thing here youre going to pick three cards youre going to write it in one of the expanded forms and then youre going to use three different colors to show it
Thats what youre going to do
If you need to finish your video you can do that and then work on those two pages
Octagons will you hand me
Hexagons you may have your snacks
Octagons come meet with me
You do not need your slate you need your math book
You need a note catcher and you need three colors I mean a pencil
A pencil your note catcher and three colors and then come join me
Can it be permanent markers can it be markers
I dont care I have the note catcher
Whats a note catcher
I have it
to use the white ones on the wall
You mean the
Yes
9 10 11 12
Hey quickly and quietly please
You have three colors
Flip them to write on
I want to be in front of this
Hey Hexagons you need to be working quietly
You just stole my paper
Why do we need markers
I already found them
Do you have your three colors
Hello
Hey Campbell youre all right
All right every one get out your math journal
Im going to start
I cant even go swimming when its summer
9 10 11 12
Put them over there behind the corridor
Where is Campbell
Give those two to her and then give this to Catherine
Give that to Catherine
All right focus up
hey five four three two one zero
If youre in group you should be ready to listen
If youre at your seat you should be working on your pages
Were watching the video
Okay
Thats and not or
Were not just going to sit there and do that
Or shit there
Okay
Felix
Yes
Youre not helping
Okay
All right
We are going to be ladies comparing decimals today
In the video they showed that you that you need to start if you look at this I can use place value strategies to compare decimals to the thousands
Pass that back to Clarissa
I know Ill understand this and I can look at each place value starting at the 10th
The 10th is the first one right after the decimal and then comparing it to the other number so Im looking at both of them in the 10th
Then if one number is bigger in the 10th then thats the bigger number
If theyre the same then you go to the 100th and you see which is bigger
Then if theyre the same then you go to the 1000th
As soon as one is bigger that tells you that your number is bigger
In our note catcher the first one is 34hundredths and 248thousandths
Im going to go around real quick and youre going to say which one is bigger and then pass this okay
On your note catcher which one is bigger 34hundredths or 248thousandths
Okay
248thousandths
Which ones bigger
248thousandths
248thousandths
Zero and 34hundredths
How do you say it again
248thousandths
248thousandths
Zero and 34hundredths
Zero and 34thousandths
He said it
Zero and 34hundredths
Zero and 34hundredths
Zero and 34hundredths
Does he know zero and 34 hundredths
Zero and 34hundredths
Great so we had a mixed response
After Catherine said it then some kid started the same
Yes
Well Daniella said it first
Remember when in the video it said that you can use
If there arent enough numbers since 034 thousandths I mean hundredths you can add a zero and it would be thousands and so 340 is definitely bigger than 248 so thats logic
You can see because in the first number theyre bringing the two
Yes
All right give it to Derrik
He wants to say something
We almost forgot about that
Hey all right
Lets listen to Derrik
Also in the video it said You would always go for the first number and whichever is bigger you would just ignore the numbers behind it
You would just ignore them
The three is bigger than the two so to the three is obviously the one that wins
Im going to change my answer
Okay
After hearing their responses
Yes
Okay
All right so what are you changing it to
I am changing my answer to 34hundredths because like Derrik said in the video you should go for whichever is bigger on the left side basically
If you add a zero to 34000 hundredths then you get 34thousandths and that is larger than 248thousandths
Okay
All right
If we look on here the number is bigger ladies in the tenths so we start in the tenths
In the tenths what do we have
A four and a four
There we go
a three and a two
A three and a two so right there ones bigger
Just as Derrik said we dont have to look past the tenths place because we already have something bigger
Is the three bigger or the two bigger
Three
The three
Okay
Campbell pass that to Gerard
I get why Campbell thought that it was 248 because the eight is bigger than the zero and the fours are the same but she probably didnt see the three and the two
Okay
Sometimes we think of the zero and we think 248 is bigger than 34
Yes
You dont add to it you dont add to the zero
Give it to Campbell
Hold on Campbells talking
My answer was going to be zero and 248thousandths but then remembering the video I looked a bit closer and I saw that you can make zero and 34hundredths into zero and 34thousandths
Okay
Give it to Derrik
I have a connection with the people that thought it was 248000 thousandths
So this one time I was doing the same thing but just with the normal numbers and I thought that 2000 was bigger than 34
I would have been correct but the three was bigger than the two so Id have got that whole thing wrong
It was fun
Okay
All right so the next one says which decimal is bigger
We have to make the alligator mouth towards the bigger one so the alligator mouth is going to face which one
How did you know
Because the three is bigger than the two
Okay the three and the tenths
Write down on there
Derrik
Derrik
When I was in first grade we made this little joke with the alligator mouth and we would draw a teeth on it and say the alligator would always go for the bigger number
Until I got to like third grade or so I thought
Why
I used to say like
Even Stephens
Oh my God
I dropped it
Oops
All right
They cant hear us over here
Lets look at the next one
Okay what decimal is bigger
One and two tenths or Thats supposed to be 2500 so we got to move down here
We got to move the decimal
How do you know
Okay three in the tenths is bigger than the two in the tents
All right so lets look at the next one
Now in this one we have a whole number so we have to start at which place
Ones
We have to start in the ones place
Lets look at this one
is it 225
I know I said we had to change the decimal
You probably didnt hear me on that
Well who has the mic
I do
Okay Derrik which ones bigger
One in 2 tenths or 25 hundredths
One in two tenths
No
Pass it
Oops
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
Two in 500hundredths
Thats supposed to be 25hundredths
Sorry
25hundredths
One in 2 tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
One in 2tenths
Just hold on
Great
Everybody I think except Donovan said one in 2tenths
Donovan how come you think Give Donovan the microphone
How come you think its 25hundredths
Well at first I thought one was in the tenths and the two was in the hundredths so thats why I thought it was two to 2500 hundredths because I thought the one was in 10th place but then I looked up at the chalkboard and then I saw that was in the ones place
You agree with the one in 2tenths
I agree with the one in 2tenths
Because theres a whole number for one and not the other that automatically makes it bigger
Derrik
Derrik
Take the microphone
Give it to Derrik
I think I know why Donovan picked that 25000 thousandths or something like that
Its because the two was before the decimal
I think thats why it made it look like it was bigger
Yes and down here I messed up
No worries it should have went 105
Yes and
No its a big
Student 4 0 and like 25
I also understand why Donovan would pick that
I was so close to picking it until I heard you say you made a mistake
I dont blame Donovan on the mistake he made because
Neither do I
I would have definitely made that mistake if you wouldnt say if you didnt say
What would it look like if there were
It looks like this up here
Just down here I wrote it wrong
Up here its right
I agree with Catherine but 25thousandths was my original answer before I saw the one and the ones or before Mrs Duncan said one and
Hi the Alligator mouth is going to face which way
One
One and two tenths right
How do you know
Because theres a whole number right
Yes
right now
All right on the last one I want you to try it on your own
Put them in order from largest to smallest
18 plus this one
One of them had a whole number
Done
Okay and then I want to show you one other thing
Done
Drake had to decide
Well Ill just have to decide what to do
I dont know I dont have that
This is Im going to do
I got it
Not the make
Wait
No look
Wait so 10 was already one of them
It would be one over 10
Look and see what goes with four three
I wont put the first one down before I solve the one on my app
All right friends I want to show you
Did you put a zero here
You can put a zero
You can
You dont have to
Im so sad
18 to know which is
I like sauce
Sauce is very
Okay
Well it
All right heres what I
Hand does
Can I show you guys something
You should say a
Can I show you something
Yes
Can I show you something
Shes talking to us
Derrik Im not sure whats happening today
Youre really good when youre participating but when Im trying to talk Im not sure whats happening
Hey the reason I gave you this is because this can be a tool that can help you
If youre not sure which is bigger then you can color in
This is why I needed you to have three different colors
This is thirtyfour hundredths and this is my two hundred and fortyeighths
Okay I can see this has more
We dont have to use this
This is a tool to help you and the interesting thing in todays math pages it doesnt have the necessary when I looked it doesnt have your practice this but this will be tonights homework
Im not sure why this is the lesson but then they dont have a practice page in the math book
Unless I didnt see it right
Are we doing the math test
Okay so your pages today that youre doing
Do we have to Can we put the one like put on there
Or for you and we have 10 minutes schedule for the
It sounds simple
This is all
If you stop on time yes
If she stops on time she only has 10 minutes
You are doing pages 121 and 122
Guys
We should get that
Will somebody push stop on the record and then hand me the microphone
