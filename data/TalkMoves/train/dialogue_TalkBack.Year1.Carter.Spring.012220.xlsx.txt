Sorry Im having technical difficulties over here
All right
I cant see it if youre holding it to the opposite wall
Thank you
Talk with your shoulder partner about your painting
Lets see if you can do what your partner did
If youre helpful or some of you keep doing what youre doing
Lets read the number
318500
Right break it in parts
Thats what expanded form means youre expanding
Okay and match
I like the way I see some people look like branching out trying other ideas
Nice job
Share your thinking with your partner its the other persons turn to go first
Im wondering why youre putting parentheses around that part
Come with me
Wait come right here
Do you see why this person put parentheses around theirs
Why did they have parenthesis
Because they were
Yes theyre showing this number and this separate number
Look at this persons why are they using parentheses
They are writing the multiplication
Yes theyre showing keep this together keep this together so what do parentheses do
They keep things together
They group things dont they
Are you trying to group this and this
No
No okay
All right
Lets try this one
If you havent tried some other methods branch out if you are ready to branch out
Try this one how do we say the number
7100
There you go try this one
Why are you saying  So is that 70
If I didnt have a one what would I call that
Id call that seven what
Flash
Thank you
Talk with your partner again
Seven times what
What did she write
What is that
Two
Onetenth plus one times
Because you moved that
Okay all right
Lets try one more
Lets say the number
90615000
There you go give that a shot
These are really simple Hudson
Are you trying to group that together
No
No keep the plus and keep the six but do you need the parentheses there
Do you need that
No
No because youre not going to group
Like if youre doing 9 x 100 youre grouping that  6 x 1 you would be grouping that does that make sense
Yes
Flash
Not many people have it done so Ill give you a moment longer
Five seconds and flash
Thats better
I think Ive finished
Thank you
Im going to have you set this on your desk
Youre going to go with your shoulder partner to another table and look at the work at that table
Notice Gosh do I agree with the thinking or not
With your shoulder partner tour to another table
Leave that slate at your table so people can look at it
You should be with your shoulder partner
You and your shoulder partner are traveling together so you can interact
You need to get this
See theyve multiplied the place values here but they didnt here
I feel like I should have done this a little differently
If you have a disagreement with someones work stay there so that when they return you can talk to them about their work all right
So if you have a question youre like This part doesnt make sense to me stay there  That makes sense
Yes
All right head back to your seats unless you need to stay there to talk to them about their work
Ready go
Ready go
This is right
No I know this ones right
Okay
This is the tenth to the zero so what should it be
6 x 10 to the 0
Or should it be 10 to go first
10 the first
Because you want one zero there right
Yes
One would be 10 to the 0
10 to the 0
Yes so it should be 10 to the 0
Youre right
Yes so that is right do you see why
Yes
I was just trying to go for a
I had the one there and I was like No
It had to be a zero
No its not going to be a one its going to be a zero
I misread what you had there
Janessa head back to your seat so people can talk with you
Thank you
If youre waiting work the math boxes while you wait because theres a couple of conversations still going on
You should be working on math boxes if youre back at your normal desk
Multiply this
All right your math message is up
Complete problems one and two on Journal page 167 please
Were just practicing
In comes in switch in comes in whats 15 of 10
15 of 10
So 10 into how many groups
Two
No break it into five groups Winfred by the denominator
So 10   5 is
25
No you multiply or something I dont know what you did
Dividing
If we have 10 counters and we had to make them into five groups how many would be in each group
Five
No wheres your
Heres again
This is one group two groups three groups four groups five groups
This is 15
This is what we just did with the counters remember
You make it into five groups so how manys in
Im confused about the talking
You said talk again
No does it say that in the directions
You talk about what you know
Got you sorry
Thank you for understanding
Talk to Royce
This is what we were just doing at the table
I know
Good job
This is the group the whole group find 15 of it
How many groups are we making
Five
Five so 10   5 is how many
Five
Really
Youd have five in each group
Two
Yes
Yes
Yes so if you were done with your spheres you would have been at the health group but you needed to finish an assignment so thats why you werent there
Now do you get what to do
Yes
You divide the big number by the only group youre putting here so 10   5 is
10 5
10   5 is 2
So 25   2 if theres 2 in the group
The groups are
Good
All right lets talk about the first table
What would go in this place right here
Show me
Good
People are showing me two
How did you get two
Noah
I got two because I drew a fraction circle
Why a fraction circle
Theres 10 items and youre finding 15 of them so why a fraction circle
Right but why a fraction circle
Im confused about that part
but I was confused about what I was going to do so I divided
Okay
Do you need to make a fraction circle
No
No
No
So how can you find 15 of any those numbers
Everybody talk about the rules with your partner how does the rule work
Okay Andrew what is the rule
How does this work
You see how many groups of five
How many groups of what
Five
Yes
Yes
Generalize that rule a little bit
If it was 12 Ill be finding how many halves so Id be dividing that by 2
If it was dividing by 14 I would be
dividing it by
Four
Four
Four
Lets go back to the learning intention here
I dont think I went over that
Maybe that would help us get this
Here we go
Read this with me please
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers
Lets try that again
That was weird
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication of fractions by whole numbers
Think what that means
Youre going to be solving a type of problem called fraction of and youre supposed to then take that and transfer it to multiplication of fractions
Thats what theyre showing you there
Theyre showing you some examples of multiplication of fractions
Youre going to be successful when you can solve the problem on a certain math page okay
Basically youre going to know youre successful when you can explain how fraction of problems connect to multiplication of fractions
Im going to pause the lesson here and Im going to do what I did at the table with some friends as a demonstration
If I have 10 of these counters let me count this quickly by counting them in groups of two
2 4 6 8 10
Heres 10
How do I find 15 of that
Youre going to share your idea with your face partner
Partner A goes first
Ready go
Ready go
Okay back to me
Thank you
Where did Anferny go
Here
There you are
Anferny how do I find 15 of 10
So theyre right here what do I do
You find dividing the number of  for the group of two
This is my group of 10 how many groups do I make it into
Im trying to find 15
How many groups do I make it into
Everybody flash me
Five five groups one two three four five
Why five groups
Because youre giving away a group
Im finding 15
15 of 10
So if I have 15 how many are in 15
Two
Two okay
Now I have 10 lets add two more so now I have a total of 12
How do I find 14 of 12
How many groups do I need to make this into
Show me
Yes four so heres a group heres a group heres a group heres a group and now Im going to keep adding
How many groups do I have
Four
Four
Whats 14 of 12
How many is 14
Three theres three in one of these groups of four
I get this I dont get this
Okay because this is what I was doing at the table with my friends because thats what that in and out table is
Thats why Im checking this with this
Lets go back to the slide show quickly really quickly
What is 15 of 25
Everybody flash it to me
Good five
What is 15 of 15
Flash it to me
Great three
What is 15 of 30
Excellent six
Thats 15 how does that relate to this in and out table
Thats what you were supposed to talk about with your partner but I feel like some people didnt understand this necessarily so youre not necessarily ready for that
Stand up if you understand this connection between this and this
Thank you
You are going to go on the rug
Those of you that are standing go on the rug please
Thank you
My friends
No stand up
Stand up
Youre not sitting stand up
My friends that dont get it youre going to go partner with one of those people so they can talk to you about that
You go find one of those friends to partner with
Talk about what those connections are
Then you could just talk this through okay
Look at his Math Journal so that you can talk about it
You see how theres three groups now
If you know what 15 is that was two but then you got three of them so 2 x 3
Six
Six
15 was five now we have three of them so 5 x 3 is 15
Does that make sense
Does that make sense
Yes
How does this one work
Yes try this one
15 x 10
15 of 15 is
Three
35 of 15 would be
Nine
Why
Because its three groups
So 3 x 3 would be 9 okay
15 is 6 but you have three of them so 6 x 3 is
Do you get this now
If you dont get it this will lessen the
You get it Im not sure you do
Do you see that youre finding one group here but now you have three of them so this is multiplying three whatever we find here
All right thank you
What do you notice
Whats the connection between the two tables
Miya
Since 10 is 2 the sentence is saying 15 is the rule
Problem one it says 35 is the rule of problem two
Since it says two out of the 10 you will do 2 x 3 and that would be the 6 right by the 10
Then you would do 5 x 3 and that would be 15 which is out of 25
Then you would do 3 x 3 which is 9 and thats out of 15 on problem two
Then we do 6 x 3 which is 18
Why are we multiplying it by three
Because the rule is 35 instead of 15 so youd have to multiply it by three
Felicia
Were multiplying it by three because on the first one we said its 15 and second one is 35 thats three times as much
That means youll have to take the 10 in the first one and the answer was 2 and then you have to multiply it by 3 to get the out of the next one
To get three times as much I like how you said that three times as much
Miya gets it but its hard to explain it sometimes and I think the key was three times as much
35 is three times as much as 15
Did you want to add to that
Got it
All right fabulous
Would this be true for every number we put in these two machines
Why or why not
Would this be true for every number why or why not
Partner Bs turn to talk first youre talking with your face partner
Ready go
Ready go
Back to me please
I heard Kayla saying something to her partner that I think everybody should talk about
If you did great if you didnt keep your appeal
Kayla tell us what you were thinking
The problem was all the ends are multiples of five so that way you can easily and mentally divide them by five but you had a number thats not a multiple of five meaning youre going to have a remainder or a fraction
Then we thought it would be hard to then multiply that fraction or the remainder by three
Thats something to consider
Im glad you know this they are all multiples of five
Do you think you could make a picture that proves this rule
To show how finding 15 of it works and how finding 13 of a whole would work
Make a picture of that
Finding 15 of a whole and finding 35 of a whole make a picture
Maybe use rectangles
Thats easier than making circles because its hard to get that even
Make a rectangle to show finding 15 and showing 35
There you go honey youre on the right track nice job
So can you show your team because theyre not
Youre on the right track show them what your thinking is
Good job Eva youre on the right track
Good job youre on the right track
Good job youre on the right track
Look at your partners
Both of these people have it
Theyre on the right track
Youre on the right track
Youre on the right track
Youre on the right track
Do you see how hes taking that rectangle and dividing it
I dont know why hes dividing into twos but maybe label it 15 so that we can see
Nice youre on the right track
So whats 15
Right here shade that in
There you go
Here make another rectangle exactly the same size
Right underneath it so you can see that its the right size
There you go
Excellent
Now make this one into 15 that show 35
The line should match up sweetie
Do you get it
Yes
Thats where youre doing it right underneath
See that youre comparing the same exactly 35
Make those same lines
Okay youre going to talk with your face partner
Its partner As turn to talk first and explain how that shows a 15 of a whole and the 35 of a whole
Now multiplying the first two
If you find 15 finding 35 is just multiplying it by three right
Yes
Good job
Does your drawing help you to understand this
Yes
Once you find what 15 is you can add 15  15  15 or you could just multiply it by three okay
All right fabulous
Im good or I need to talk about it to someone
Okay
I see somebody brave enough to say they dont quite have it yet so were going to have somebody get up and put theirs under the document camera
Sienna can you take yours I see that you have the right idea and its labeled
Thank you
Away goes Sienna thank you
You can just move those babies out of your way
Thank you
Eyes up at the Ms Carter
So I used rectangles to  because youre shading 15 of the whole which is 10
So I shaded in 15 of it because were finding 15 and we know that its two because
Can you just count it out
Can you go 2 4 6 8 10 to show us how that works on your first one
No on your very first diagram show us how its two
How do you know thats two
Because 2 4 6 8 10 then it goes to 10 twos an 5 x 2
So I ran with that two and since I only wanted to find 15 I just shaded that one and so that finished marking to the cube but then for the 35 of 10 finding 35 I shaded three parts because we need to find 35
Again 2 4 6 8 10 so they would all be two
Then since theres three twos we want to add them all together and that would be six
What would be the number model for this
I could see two different number models
What would be a number model for this
Put that on your slate please
Lets give Sienna a round of applause
What is a number model that shows those
Put them on your slate
Like 15  15  15  35 right
That explains your model right
Yes
Or 15 x 3 yes
I see some people doing this
Would that work
Yes
Yes
Yes
Would this work
15 x 3 35 yes
I saw some people doing this
Is that what were doing
No
No thats how we found what 15 was but this is like matching our diagrams that we were making
15 15  15  35
When we found that it was two for 15
2  2  2  6 or 2 x 3  6 right
Theres the number model to prove our picture today
Lets find 16 of 18
Find 16 of 18
Put it on your slate 16 of 18
Flash
Great
Explain to your partner how you found out it was three
Partner Bs turn to talk first
I get it
Okay
Now I get it
All right so what is 56 of 18
If you know 16 is 3 what is 56
Put it on your slate
If 16 is 3 what is 56
Flash
Thank you
You said 15 youre on the right track
Talk with your partner how you found 15
Three
Was three
So now you have five of that
5 x 3  15
Do you see why
Yes
If you know that 16 is 3
Youre going to do it five times so thats why we just multiply 3 x 5
Does that make sense
Does that make sense
Yes that makes sense now
Okay
All right lets try another one
What is 110 of 50
And flash
Five
Good
Its five
How did you get five Eli
I got five and I know the multiplication said it is 10
I did it in my head I did what times 10 equals 50
I know that 5 x10  50 and thats why I got five
I like your thinking
Could you do it by dividing too
Yes
Yes
Yes
Somebody that did it as division explain their thinking Rowdy
I did 50 divided 10 and I was trying to see how many groups of 10 were in 50 and I know that it is five
Nice
Now we found 110 of 5
Now knowing that 110 of 50 is five
What is 710
flash
Good talk with your partner about why its 35
Its 15 Reese is five but we have seven of them
So 5 x 7 35
Once you find what 15 is thats like the one but then you have three of them so you multiply those
Timesing the numerator
Trey back to me please
Thank you
What would the process be
If you wanted to just go straight from if I said find 710 of 50 what would the process be
Because Ive walked you through the process
Youre explaining to your partner what would the process be to find 710 of 50
What would the first step be and the second step
Youre going to find somebody to talk to
So stand up
Stand up
right here
Right here
This is not a good match
We already know that you both struggle so would it be a good plan to get to people
Because you know  I dont know if  at all but you want to  with somebody
Does that make sense
Does that make sense
All right
Does that make sense
Does that make sense
Okay
All right
Thank you
So what would be the steps
Theres two of them
What would you do Lexie
The first step would be to find out 110 of the  would be 10
Yes 10th right
So I thought the 50 would be so I had a dividing and multiplying and then once you know that thats five you would multiply it by seven because youre finding 710 so you would have seven fives seven times five is 35
Nicely explained
Nicely done
Thank you
Would this work with any whole number
Yes finding 14 of it and then multiplying times the numerator if its finding 35
So finding 416 whatever it is
Okay
Youre going to write an expression on your slate to model this problem
Do you solve it
No
No
No
Youre writing the expression
If I have three sets of four coins how many coins in all
So write the expression
Three sets of four coins how many coins in all
Write the expression
How would I solve that problem
The number model its the expression
And flash
Good
If you said three times four youre on the right track
Why is it three times four Gracey
Three times four because if you have four groups of three yes it would be three times four because
Theres three groups of four
Thank you
Lets try it again
If you have eight rows of eight stamps how many stamps in all
Whats the expression
Eight rows of eight stamps
And flash
There you go
Talk with your shoulder partner about why thats eight times eight
like and then
is eight times eight
Because theres eight
Yes because
All right
Back to me
Back to me
Emma why is it eight times eight
It will be eight times eight because youre basically taking the two numbers from the problem then multiplying them
Okay
Thats true but why is it eight times eight
Itll also be eight times eight because you have eight stamps and eight rows
So theres a group of eight eight different times
Yes
Okay
Thats what Im looking for not just you saying again its eight times eight
Thank you
Lets try one more
Six bags of 12 oranges
How many oranges in all
And flash
Me I know
Good
If you explained first last time you explain second this time
Ready
Go
It will be eight times 12
12 oranges
Theres six bags
So you just put 12 in these bags
Right
I found a way  and I got back at where its 60
Not exactly
Okay
Why is it six times 12
David
Six times 12
Why is it six times 12
Why is six bags of oranges with 12 in each bag six times 12
Because there are six bags with 12 oranges in each
That will tell you how many in all
Okay
What operation are we using in each of these examples
Yay
Were all multiplying
Okay
Now were going to involve the fraction piece with this
Are you ready
What is 34 of a bag of carrots
What is 34 of a bag of carrots
Whats the expression for that
34 of a bag of carrots
34 of a bag of eight carrots
34 of a bag of eight carrots
Did I say it wrong
Yes
You said
Sorry
Im rattled
Im looking at the clock and going Ive got to change something about what Im doing here
34 of a bag of eight carrots
34 of a bag of eight carrots
And flash
Im glad
I see most people getting the hang of this
If you have 34 times eight youre on the right track
Talk with your partner about why its 34 times eight
Well
solving this
Youre supposed to be multiplying
You are giving me the expression 34 of eight
I dont know why
Okay
Did you already talk yet
eight times 34 because
Okay
Back to me
Back to me
Why is it represented as 34 times eight
Why is it represented that way Emma
Its represented that way because you have 34 of one bag that has eight carrots
Okay
TRUE
Who can elaborate on this
Who can explain this a little more
Brandon
Its 34 times eight because of the value of eight here
Its pretty much like what we did in our math journal where we said 10 times 15 or whatever because were just doing its pretty much saying the opposite of what we did its just saying two times
Its like what we did in our journal pretty much
Well its not the opposite Im just saying its not 10 times 15 its like 15 of 10
Kaya
Another way to really to visualize it is if youre thinking of one whole and one whole times itself so if youre multiplying one whole by 34 youre then getting 34 of the whole
That is actually going to be 34 of the whole as being eight
I like your thinking
Thank you
I get what youre saying
All right
Im going to just turn you loose but Im going to have you work with your partner
All right
Youre going to work on the rest of that page 167 where your math message was
Working together
Working together
Should one person be dominating
No
No
No
No
Working together
Take turns
I hesitate to say sage and scribe
Work them together
Share your thinking working and checking sage and scribing discussing
Were going to come back in a few minutes
If you finish I do have a game
Nine divided by
Okay
Okay
So I guess it will be 23 of whatever like 23 of 12
So then weve got to figure out the odd number
We basically do  make it easier so I can explain easier for you
13 of 12 and then we just times that by three
By two because its 23 but you have it
Nice job
13 of six is
13 of 12 is four but they have 23
Oh okay
So four times two would be eight
Yes
Yes
You see your fix up there
I think  are erasable
Yes because you wouldnt be allowed to use it even if it works
Yes
Great
Keep working together
Three
I cut the side of each half
If you have six of these heres six whats 13
13 would be
No thats 23
Thats half
We can make this into three groups
Right
There you go
You have three groups
So whats 13
Two
Two but you have 23 so that would be
Eight
One
Two
This is one group
This is another group
This is now 23
So how much is that
Four
You see why its four
Yes
You divided this into three groups you found 13 first but you had two of them
So one group plus another group is 23 because two times two is four
Okay
Now you have a total of 12
Right
Two four six eight
How many more do I need
One more
Heres four more so now I have 12
Do you see that
Two four six eight 10 12
Whats 13 of this
How many groups do we make that into if were making a third
There you go
Three groups
13 is four but we need 23
You just divided it into half
This is 13
13 plus 13 is how many thirds
23 right
So how many is in 23
Were going to do one more
Heres nine
Whats 13 of nine
Play the game
Its called Fraction of
You can get on your computer to play it
Its Fraction of
Thats what you do next Fraction of
Good
So 13 is how many
Three
Three
So 23 is
Six
There you go
Is that making sense Lucas
Okay
Were doing all that
No
No
No
Were going to play the game
Look at the clock
Keep going
How much is
14 of eight eight divided by four is two
Thats for 14 but you have three of them
Youre trying to find 34
14 is two but you have three of them
So
Oh this will be times three
Two times three is
It would be
Two times three is
Two times its six
Can you see why
You are only finding 14
You have to find this 14 to help you find the 34
You are doing the same thing
You found 14 because if you have eight things
Oh so now I have to find 34 Oh okay
Do you see what your fix up is
Yes
Okay
Im just going to grab something
Okay
Okay
I dont know what were doing here
Talk to me about this
Whats 14 of eight
14 of eight
Yes
Yes
Two
Good but you have 3 4
So if you know 14 is two what would 34 be
That is multiplication
Right
Thats what multiplication is finding fraction of
Oh so its kind of the same thing
Right
Remember what we just did on this slate where we said Four bags of oranges eight rows of stamps eight rows of groups of stamps
Do you see why its still multiplication
Yes
I dont think I was really explicit
14 is two so 34 would be
Two
Not two
Yes two times
14 is two
It should be two times three
Uhhuh
Do you see why its six
Because 14 is two but you have 34
Then you got to times it with that
Yes
Yes
You have four here but that doesnt make sense because that would be half of this
Thats how I knew Oops there is a little fixup
Whats 14 of eight
But you have three of them so
Its six
So whats 14 of 10
Twenty divided by four is
Five
Five
Thats 15 or 14 but you have three of them
See how we went from 15 to 35
Thats what youre doing here
Whats 14 of 16
Four
But you have three of them so you have
Twelve
You got this
Yes
Okay
Weve got some problems here friends
I love the effort
Nice job with trying
Lets talk about this
If I have eight things I want to find 14 of them
Whats 14 of eight
14 of eight would be four
No thats half because 2 x 4  8
So two is 14 but you have 34
So 2 x 3 is
Six
Six
You dont need to put six over four
Okay
So whats 14 of 20
14 of 20 would be six
No
Twenty divided by four is
Twenty divided by four
Four
Four times four is 16
Thats four times five
Four times five is 20
So five is 14 but how many fourths do we have
Three
Five times three is
Fifteen
Fifteen
We have  15
Yes exactly
See how were finding the unit fraction of 14 and then well find times three because theres 34
Does that make sense
Does that make sense
Mmhmm
Okay
So talk me through this
14 of 16 is
Four
Good
So then three of those would be
Would be 12
Yes 12 because you have fourths
Okay
Twenty is
Now you have
You divide it by four first so 20 divided by four is
Because five times four is 20
Therefore
Seven
Seven
So seven 14 but we have three of those
So seven times three is
Seven times three is 21
Perfect
Yes
Yes
Now you need to find this strategy down here because this is  fraction
Okay
Does that help
Yes
You guys seem like a really positive group and youre actually working
Nice job
Nice job
Yes
Yes
Do you think five and six
Yes
Yes
Good job you guys
It looks like youve got this figured out now
Good
Would you need counters to do them all
