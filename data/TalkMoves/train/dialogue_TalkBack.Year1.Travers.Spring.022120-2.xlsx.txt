thinking maybe what we could do is pass out the review ahead of time so that you can just bring your review to the carpet
When youre with me youll bring your  to Ms Travers
Agree
Then when youre doing this do you want them to solve number 10
I think so
This is number 10 in your math packet
Yes
Yes
Yes
By yourself right
Or with a partner
I think its okay of they sit with each other and talk through it together
Okay
You have to be with a partner within your group
Your group
Then once you and that partner have gone through and talked through number 10 then they can grab the fraction match cards and
Right
Yes
Yes
Yes
Okay
SoTis bringing you your review
When you have it if youre in Group A you are going to come to the carpet with the clipboard
If you are in Group B youre going to come to the back table with the clipboard and pencil
If youre in Group C you will work on Number 10
Ms Herd
Yes
Yes
Yes
Turn the page please
So youve already done some of this
Yes
Excellent
Okay
Then you can be the expert
Okay
Ms Jackson is it okay if I move this to the back
Oh yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Can you push that down for me honey
Thank you
All right
Matthew Owen can you move those chairs for me so I can push the back
Why are they over there
I asked them to
What group are you in
You just be responsible for you
the carpet
No
Seat
Desks
Excuse me friends
Thank you Claire
Thank you Claire
Are they recording
I dont think they are
Keep going
I just caught the red light and the flash
I said it youre on this side Matthew
Youre up right here
Until youre like Really close together
All right
Ms Herd what are these for
I would normLily want to be partnered
Theyre just listening to the words were talking about in math
I dont think  maybe its recording
It is
It just listens to the words that we talk about in math
Go up to Ms Jackson please
It might be at your desk
Theres four at each table
Right
Am I right
All right
Wait
Is she Fern
my choice for us girls or should we just stay where we are
Lets stay
I dont think Nolan he doesnt want to do it
So friends what number are we starting with
We had to
Thats fine
Fern why dont you just grab that chair
Maybe you could just come sit right here
Is this an extra
Yes
Ill put this in the middle
Sit over here
Lily is she gone
Oh okay
Lily is it okay if I put this on your desk
Lily is it okay if I set this on your desk
Okay
All right
So friends we are starting on Number 11 and our goal on number 11 is to were going to go ahead and just read through some of these together and start solving
Are you on Number 11
Okay
Were all starting on Number 11 together
Okay
So friends Number 11
Hannah will you read it for us
Draw pictures of these turns using your arc to show the direction of each one
The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you
Okay
What is this one asking us to do
What is Number 11 asking us for
Its asking us to draw pictures of turns using an arc to the direction of each one
Okay
So what do we have
The vertex of the angle and one side have already been drawn for you
Okay
So on Number 11A we have something like this right
We need a halfturn clockwise
What does that look like
Excuse me
So half a turn
So were facing right here and then I think we have to figure out
Stand up
to do a half turn
Right
So if were standing and were facing the front right
That way youre facing this way the arrow
Like the arrow this way
Okay
What would a halfturn look like
Are we going clockwise or counterclockwise
Clockwise
Clockwise
So we would go half turn
We would just draw an arrow this way
Okay
So it would look like
Wait
How are we
Can I see
Okay
I get that
So it was like this and a half turn would mean now its
Like that
like that because it went all the way a halfway turn the same way the hands go on a clock
So what would it look like on B
Onefourth of a turn counterclockwise
Right
So 11B starts like this
Right
Onefourth of a turn
Onefourth of a turn
Daniel well tell us what youre thinking
Im thinking we show a clock mostly turns right so we should do it left in like a quarter of a half turn
So what do you mean by a quarter of a halfturn
Instead of doing a full half turn you want to cut
If you do a full half turn and just erase half of that
Im hearing you say half of half is one quarter
Yes
Or onefourth times two is one half
Yes
So that would look like one quarter turn counterclockwise would be what
Yes
Like that
So now it would be facing this way
Yes
If this turned a quarter turn counterclockwise this arrow would now be this way
Is that what youre saying
A quarter of a turn
You guys agree disagree
I agree I think
So Luke I want to see in yours I want you to draw in on this one on 11A and 11B
You need to draw in what the new arrow would look like
Okay
On 11A it makes a halfturn clockwise and on 11B its one quarter turn counterclockwise
Right
Noah what do you need honey
Im thinking
Okay
You did Number 10
Sam what are you working on honey
Im doing the same
So the directions are you finish Number 10 and then you play what
There you go
What about one through nine
Were going to switch in a few minutes
Okay
12
Lets keep going friends
Wait
Then how would this one be
Like that
Yes
Yes
Yes
Okay
Why Zoe
Because we are turning that way
A quarterturn counterclockwise
Number 12 is estimate the size of the angle
What are our choices
Ninety to a hundred 180  180
Okay
Youre sitting at some groups of four
I want you to talk about what estimate What do you think the answer is and why
You need to look at where the arch is on the angle
I think that would be 90 through 180 degrees because its like almost a right angle its just a tad bit
Yes
Its up to
Well wait
Yes
Nolans right
Nolans right
Nolans right with the 90 between 180
Are you measuring where 90 degrees would be
Smart thinking
Tell me why youre doing that
I think we should maybe circle 90 to 180 degrees so that we know its that one
If its obtuse what are you circling
Good
Okay
You guys got 90 to 180
What did you guys get
We got 90 to 180
Excellent
Move on to the next
Angle ABC what would you name that
Acute obtuse or right
Acute obtuse or right
Obtuse
Obtuse
Good
Lets do the next one
I think its a zero between 90
Talk to your team and tell your friends why
Because its less than like a 90degree turn
I think its zero through 90
Why
Zero to 90
How do you know
The angle is smaller than 90 degrees
How do you know
Because thats pointing this way
If it were a right angle or 90 degrees it would be like that and its
The line  would meet at a perfect  degrees
Pointing like that
Youre good
Great
Keep going
So  you guys say acute
Yes
Acute
Acute
Okay
My friends Im excited to do Number 13
This is one of the lessons we did when I was here
What does the word symmetry or symmetric mean
If a figure has symmetry
Would you please tell your teammates talk about what is symmetry
Symmetry its where its the same on both sides
The same what on both sides
If its the same  shape
Say that word again
The image would be reflective on a line of
I think we should first draw  because there are so many ways you can do it
Youre kind of like drawing
So we got to go this we go to go this we got to go this
No
No
No
Only one line
Why
No
Draw all the lines of symmetry
When it says draw all the lines of symmetry what I want to talk about on Number 13A is how many lines of symmetry will we be drawing
Four
Lets think about that and then well share
Could you have a reflection any other way on that
Thank you Luke and Lily
Can I hold this up for a second
I dont know
I came up with all those answers
Friends what do you Does this show symmetry
Right here
Right here
If we drew a line right here could we fold it and both sides would match up perfectly it would be a reflection
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Do you see where you need to add
Now this is not symmetry
It has to be perfect
The lines when you match up if it folded it would have to line up perfectly
Good
Ms Jackson can we switch in like two minutes
I know and I think they may just have to continue on
I think its really good to have these smaller group conversations
All right
On Number 14 what is a strategy to draw the other half
We could measure it
How did you know what to do
We could fold it in half and
Fern will you tell us how did you know what to do
Because I know its a square you could  a diamond and a Its half
Okay
On number 14 how do you know what to draw where
You just kind of look at it
You kind of copy it
When you say look at it look at what
Look at the shape of it
Its like
Or you could fold it the reflection
What youre thinking about is if it was flipped over the line if that figure was flipped over the line of symmetry what would it look like on the other side
Yes
Look at that strategy Ferns doing folding the paper
Remember when we did that
Thats another way to check
Thats not
Its not what
She just did that on a math test
Friends Number 15 is similar to what we did yesterday
Remember yesterday we had this chart and were solving multistep multiplication number stories
This is a clue to you what kind of problem are you going to have on Number 15
Were going to talk about it
Were going to talk about it for just a minute
What kind of problem will we have
A multistep
Remember we need
Story
A single
Number
Youre going to have to write it out as a number model and you will need parenthesis
Okay
So lets read through it
You guys can just work on 15 and talk through it
Okay
Three boys each want to buy a football and a science kit
Together they have 65
If each football costs 8 and each science kit costs 11 how much money will the boys have left over after theyve purchased the items
Remember our chart up here
What is the problem asking and what are the steps
Or we could do three times and then we could do like
What are you guys thinking that Number 15 is asking us to find
I think its asking us to find how much it costs in total
No
Find
Part of it is
Find how much money the boys will have left over
Were going to find how much the total would be and then how much money is left after they buy those items
Yes
Whats our strategy for setting up this problem
I think I know
Everybody think for a minute
What is it
Everybody write down how to set it up and then well see if we have similar thinking
Tell me why you have three times eight
Because three times eight is the football and then three times 11 is the science kit and then minus
So the first thing you have to do is find that total
Dash was asking us
I would find that total first
You want to find out how much money is it going to cost them to buy those items
6500
Yes but Correct
You could but is this addition or multiplication
Multiplication
Are you sure about that
Of course
Well lets think about it
What would you need
Why would we need addition not multiplication
Because multiplication if we add this total and this total then you would multiply those  because that would be not the correct answer
Were looking for adding the two amounts together
How much do the footballs cost
How much do the Whats the other thing
Science kits
Science kits
We put those two totals together
Then we can do equals
What do we know so far
How much do the footballs cost
800
And how many boys are there
Three
We have to do eight boys times 3 right
Start with what we know
Then we have
11
I love how you have three times eight and 11 times three
What do we need to do with these two amounts
What would that unknown letter be
D for dollars maybe
Is this a plus or a times
Were going to be adding the two of them
Guys Im done
Whats three times eight
Youre going to figure out both of these and then add those both together
What if its wrong
Three times eight 24
Its not wrong
You dont know that
I did all the math
I have no  and I have no
Ladies and gentlemen high five
Thank you so much for getting quiet so quickly
We are going to do a switch
What are you doing
My friends  right here because we didnt get through to Number 9  the math game once we finish Number 10
Great idea
Then I want you and your partner to go back and finish the ones we didnt finish the one through nine
The math game is only when youre done with your problems
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
My friends on the carpet I want you to be with your same partner
Youre going to do Number 10 with your partner and then youre going to go back and do finish one through eight
Great
All right
Freeze please
If you work at the carpet you are going to come to me at the back table now
If you were at the back table you are going to go to the desks now
Do we work with partners
You may or by yourself
If you are the desks you are going to head to the carpet
The answer is 45
Ms Jackson can you play your bell
All right
Move to your next rotation please
Its okay if youre not quite done but were going to move on to the next part
You can be our expert
Talk to us about your thinking
Id like you to please turn to Number 11
Why is this split
It just helps us all fit in
Excellent
Is this an extra one
All right guys
Lets look at Number 11
On Number 11 Mason do you need to find someone to work with honey
You can sit with Luke
You can sit over here sit over here
Its up to you
All right
Number 11
Can everybody put their finger on Number 11 so I know youre with me
Number 11
Number 11
Were going to be drawing pictures to show the rotations
Okay
Remember our lesson where we stood up and we turned our bodies for different rotations clockwise and counterclockwise
Thats what were doing here but instead of our bodies were looking at the line segments or in this case this would be a line because it goes on and on
What were doing is were Can everybody see where I am right now from where youre sitting
If we are looking at this line right here and were turning it a half
A half turn
Half turn clockwise
Were turning to the right
Oh your right
Were turning it
This arrow would move a halfturn clockwise and now our line segment would be looking like this
Get your pencil ready
Youre going to touch the end of the arrow and youre going to do a halfturn clockwise
After a halfturn clockwise then we draw in the line segment
Okay
Now what is B asking us to do
One fourth turn counterclockwise
Onefourth of a turn
Onefourth of a turn
Instead of clockwise were going to
Left
To the left the opposite direction
Take your pencil and touch the top of the arrow and were going to turn counterclockwise
How do we know how far to go
Its one fourth
We did one whole right there so about 180 degrees
One hundred eighty is a half
Its going to be 270
Thats three fourths
My friends think about quarters think about dollars
If you have 1 how many quarters is one quarter
Four
Well how many quarters are in a dollar
Four
Four
One quarter means one out of four
Were going onefourth of a turn or a quarter of a turn counterclockwise
Heres my arrow
Heres my arrow and Im going to go counterclockwise a quarter of a turn
Yes
Yes
Yes
You got it
counterclockwise a quarter of a turn
counterclockwise a quarter of a turn
Okay
Lets keep going
Michael can you read Number 12 for us
Estimate the size of the angle
Circle the best answer
Okay
I want everyone to think to themselves and were going to do thumbs up if I read what you think it is
Look at the angle ABC right here
Can you please thumbs up if you think angle ABC is between zero and 90 degrees
Thumbs up if you think its between 90 and 180
Thumbs up if you think its 180 to 270
Anyone willing to share their thinking how they know
I think its zero through 90 number one because C right there it would probably be 90
What does a 90degree angle look like
It looks like that
Exactly
If a 90degree angle is a perfect
A perfect
This ones like this
Does this angle look like its Look where the arc is
I think 90 degrees would be like this
Liza
I think its the second one 90 degrees No 180 degrees to 270 because if this was 90 Wait
No
Yes if this was 90 itd be right here or
Can I have everyone look right up here on my paper
This is what a 90degree angle looks like
Look at the arc
Is our arc
I cant see
Right here
Right here
No
Is it a little bigger than 90 degrees
Yes
But this is 180 is it all the way at 180
No
No
No
No
So we know its not 180 to 270
Its too big
Thats too big
Aiden can I have your eyes please
We know that if this is 90 we know its greater than 90 degrees
Since this ray right here is in between 90 and 180 we would call This angle is between 90 and 180 degrees
Its bigger than 90 but its less than 180
What do we call an angle that is bigger than 90 degrees but less than 180
Think through that
Look at the three choices we have
Acute obtuse or right
Acute obtuse or right
If an angles bigger than Its greater than 90 but less than 180
What do you guys think
Talk to your partners
I think its obtuse
Say it out loud
Obtuse
It is obtuse
Good
Write down the word obtuse please
I already did
Excellent
Did you already know that
Good
Then I want to hear your thinking Joey
Okay
So lets look at B
This time I want you guys to look at letter B
Youre looking at angle BOX and I want you to talk with your table mates
Do we think that one is zero to 90 90 to 180 180 to 270 and name it acute obtuse or right on the line
You have 20 seconds to talk
Go
I think its acute
Yes its acute
Zero to 90
How do you know
I know because this one is going that like this and like Landon said its like an L if it was 90 degrees so it has to be 180 if its more up than that one because this one is kind of down  This ones straightup
I always want you to think about 90 degrees of this kind of angle that s 90 degrees it s what we re measuring against
If something smaller if the arc is smaller than 90 degrees inside the 90 degrees we always call that acute
So your answer honey is not going to be this 180
One hundred eighty means it s bigger
This is what it is
Zero to 90 is acute
Oh I thought it was  that one is like this and it was more like
It s not how long the line segments are
It s you re looking at where this arc is
If the arc inside this 90degree mark that means it s less than 90 degrees
Thank you
You re welcome
That s why we re doing this
Okay
Let s do one more and then you guys might need to finish on your own
Good
Thirteen and 14 are symmetry
Remember the lesson where we drew the lines of symmetry
No
You weren t here
That s a good thing we re revealing huh
Wait
What day was it
It was Wednesday
Remember that a line of symmetry What is a line of symmetry
Lucas tell us what you re thinking
The first one I thought because the square if you ve got a square piece of paper you could fold it one way which will be parallel to
Like this
If you drew a line down the middle and we folded it would the edges matchup
Yes
Then you could also do another line across
Like this
Yes
Because both lines are  all you could to do
Could there be any other lines
What do you think
I think there should be across like through the middle
So what if I fold it from this corner to this corner like this
If I folded that would those corners matchup
So what does that tell us
That either one two three there s three
Three lines of symmetry
Could there be four
Yes because it can go the other way
We folded it on this line of symmetry would the corners match up
Yes
You may
Ms Jackson just told us
She said sometimes there could be as many lines as how many sides on a shape
Sometimes
Look this has four sides
Look we have one two How many lines of symmetry
Four
Look at the next figure
The next figure has four sides and there s not four lines of symmetry
How many lines of symmetry on the next figure
One
What s the figure called
Pentagon
No
Trapezoid
No
No
No
Thats four sides
Trapezoid
Trapezoid
Well how would you fold it this way because this side is bigger than that side
What if we had If this is the figure
You re not folding it down
No
If you fold it that way it would be too big
See how it s similar to this
Yes but if you fold it from this side
Yes
Why do you have that
I would fold it right here so that this corner would line up with this one
Wait because you couldn t go down the middle
You can t do it this way
It wouldn t match
Yes because if you fold it up it will just be a little off
Exactly
Liza
With this one I think it s a quadrangle
I think
What does quadrangle mean
It s a foursided shape
You got it
Quad means four
Then it would be a square rectangle or slanted square
Where would the line of symmetry be on C
C looks like this
It s almost a square
What makes this not a square
Because the sides are more slanted than that
Do we have four right angles
Yes
We don t have four right angles but we have four sides
What also doesn t make any square is that a square has of four lines of symmetry and this one only has
If we folded it here what would happen
It would be overlapped
It got overlapped but
If the corners wouldn t match up perfectly that s not a line of symmetry
Unless you folded it open
On onefold
Could we fold it here
Yes
Would this match perfectly with this
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Are there any other lines of symmetry on this shape
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
What about here
Yes
Are there any others
I think we can do a line like fold it
This way
You can t fold a line down the middle
You know what my friends
You can t
Here
If I folded this watch my hands
My friends I want you to watch my hands
Look where my finger is
Okay
If I fold this right now watch where my hand goes
Is it going to match up
No
No
No
No
We cannot have a line of symmetry here
That one will come down here and then that one will come over there
What about this side
If I put a line of symmetry here and I flipped it look where my hand would end up
Over here
Would it line up
No
These are the only two lines of symmetry on this figure
Like  said you can t do that way because
Ms Jackson how much
They re okay
We re done too
Ready
I m actually done
We re in a good stopping point too
We might still have Number 14 and 15 to do but you can do when you have some extra time
Okay
Fourth graders high five
Thank you so much Owen
You turned and faced me so quickly
Okay
Friends we have one more rotation
Wherever you have not been that s where you re going now
My friends  what you would want to do then is once you finish Number 10 you want to make sure that you finish the rest of whatever youre doing
I m going to show them a tip on Number 10
Okay
Please switch
My friends I want to show you a tip on Number 10
Can I see all of your papers please
I want you to look at mine
We re making a line plot
Can you see mine Gage
I want you to look right here my line plot
You need to do your labels
These are the data points right here
Up here
Look at what I started with
What did I start with here Liza
Two and one half
Two and one half
Your interval is half centimeters
Two and one half three three and one half four four and one half
Okay
Go try it
Help each other
Okay
Go
Friends meet me over here
Hi I m so excited to spend a few minutes with you guys a few more minutes
It s a good review
All right
Gage where s Do you need to go seeTor you guys are at the table
Logans okay
All right
These are pretty fun
We re starting on Number 11
Matthew and Noah are you ready to start with us on Number 11
Yes
Do you need a chair
There s one right here
No
I understand
Is this one of your papers
That s Logan s
Logan
Here you go honey
Is this yours too
Yes
There you go my dear
You re welcome
Okay friends
I want you guys to be the leaders
I want you to ask
We re going to go through these one at a time but I want you to be the leaders not me
Emily read Number 11
Tell us what you think we re doing
Thank you Mia
Number 11 says draw pictures of these turns using an arc to show the direction of each one
The vertex of the angle in one side have already been drawn
It will be like we re making an angle
You are making the angle
Noah tell us how you knew what to do
Wait
I havent done it yet
I ll tell you
It set for a 120 clockwise
I drew the other half of the angle which is just
I drew half of the clock
I drew half of a circle and an arrow at the right end
I did this with a couple of my other groups
Noah does yours match mine
Oh but is it okay if I
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes my
Wait but that would be turning counterclockwise
If you put the arrow above then it would be turning counterclockwise and it says to turn clockwise
No hes still moving
Hes still moving clockwise
Yes
Yes
Yes
Hes going to the left to the right
Its okay
Okay and B is instead of a halfturn London will you read B for us 11B
Onefourth turn counterclockwise
All right
Perfect
If I have to write an equation
Were going onequarter of a turn counterclockwise
I did it like this
Oh I did a quarter
Thats why
Good
You got that
I did it like this
Smart thinking friends
Okay
What I want you each to do is hold up your paper so we can check each others and look at your neighbors
Look at neighbors on both sides
Look at your neighbors on both sides
Matthew
Matthew look at my counterclockwise
I cant see yours
Oh I did it that way
I think you did clockwise honey
See the difference
You have to go the other direction for counterclockwise
There you go honey
Okay
Sam Number 12 is you
Estimate the sides of the angle
Circle the best answer
I want everyone to look at angle ABC
Sam I want you to tell us what youre thinking
Then ask your friends around you if they agree
I think its in between 90 and 180 degrees
Can I share my thinking
I agree
Well Sam is going to tell us his thinking and then hes going to ask for someone to addon
Okay
It looks like since the bottom line stayed straight it looks like this turned
It looks like its more than 90 degrees
Its more than a hundred degrees
Great
Call on someone to share their thinking
They might agree disagree addon
I agree because the arrow is pointing to the right so its not turning all the way
How do we know this angle is less than 180 degrees
I know its less than 180 degrees because if you draw another line going backwards  in the opposite direction
Its not facing it and its higher so its not going to be that
Got it
The  it makes its not one side to the other side
So 180 degrees would mean this line would be straight across
Yes
So we know its less than 180
Yes then it has to be this one because its more than
Also
So 180 degrees would be this line all the way across right here
Its bigger than that and
No because its less than
This arc right here is what were looking at
Does that make sense
Yes
This is 180 so we know this is more than 90 but less than 180
You did awesome Sam
Thank you for sharing
I love it
I was going to say you can sometimes get confused of which way its going because or if its going this way you know its not going to be  its going the other way
TRUE
I see what youre saying
I like that
What do we name this angle
Obtuse
Obtuse
Obtuse
Write it down
Oh okay
I thought it meant like
Because we know it is less than 180
Hang on honey
We have one more
Obtuse goes here
This is a different answer
We can talk about it later
Okay
I think I actually know
12B Matthew will you read it for us
the next one
Estimate the sides of the angle circle the best answer
To me it looks like its the other way
What do you mean by the other way
Well not going a different way but like kind of  on the A and B
Matthew our three choices are right here zero through 90 90 to 180 or 180 to 270
I think zero to 90 because if it was here that would be 260 and it couldnt be behind 260
If it was just slightly there past zero
Can you have someone to addon to your thinking please
Logan
I was doing this in my head
I was imagining a line here and this is 90 degrees
Do you agree with Matthew that its less than 90
Yes
Youre showing why
I think it would be zero through
Can you pull this up so the other kids can see how you did that
Do you see how Logan drew in where the 90 degrees is
Angle BOX is less than 90 degrees
And then he said
I got BOX
Finish what you were saying
the angle BOX
This would be angle
I thought that is should be like zero through 89 instead of 0 through 90 because I think this is an acute angle and acute is different than
Less than 90
Yes and
I see what youre saying
