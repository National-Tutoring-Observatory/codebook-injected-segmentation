Thanks for sharing
Yes
Yes
You may show that
I know that its not equivalent because 25 isnt a multiple of two because you cant get five from two so you cant get 25 from two
Thanks for sharing
Okay
Let me go back to Ms Dover could you  for me and get it back to my slideshow
All right
Friends would you please stand up
Keep your whiteboard and your marker on your desk
Thank you so much for doing that right away
Im going to show you a breathing technique that gets our mind ready for learning because when our brains get oxygen they do their best learning
Were going to do something called four four eight
Stand up please
Say four four eight
Four four eight
Turn and face me in the back
Four four eight
Were going to breathe in for four
Were going to hold it for four
Were going to breathe out for eight
You have to breathe out really slow with your lips in a little O because you have eight seconds of breathing out
Watch me first
Watch me how I breathe in through my nose
I hold for four breath out through my mouth
Ready
Ready
Watch
Ready to try it
Okay
Breathe in for four
Hold for four
Out for eight
Slowly
Okay
Take a regular breath or two
Were going to do it one more time
Oh I did not say start talking
Ready
Ready
In for four
Thank you
Please get your whiteboard and mark pen
May I have If youre wearing a shirt that has black on it anywhere a black stand up
You are reading todays learning intentions
Ready
Ready
If youre standing youre reading
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Today we will try out different ways to express remainders for division problems
Please sit down
Stand up if you do not have black on your shirt
No Im sorry
Im surprised the lady doesnt have doesnt have black
Question
Excuse me
My friends what I need right now is youre standing youre reading this question
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
What is a remainder
Everybody sit down and think
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
Dont talk
Just think
Jot down on your whiteboard what do you know about remainder itself
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
Please stand up
Without talking I want you to stand up and face your shoulder partner at your desks
Stand up and face your shoulder partner
That means youre going to be standing and turning your body to see your shoulder partner
stand up
Thats why Im doing this so I can help you find your shoulder partner
If you have the shortest hair I want you to share first
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
What is a remainder
When that person is done the other person will share
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Remainders are numbers that you can
You should be talking with your partners
Both partners have shared
Can you add anything to it
Can you add anything
Okay
Ladies and gentlemen please close your conversation
Thank your partner
Check the definition that you have on your whiteboard right now
Check
Look at the definition you have on your whiteboard right now
These are a couple things I saw
A remainder is the leftover from a division problem
If I read something that you agree with will you stand up
Were going to stand up if you agree stay seated if you dont agree
Ready
Ready
A remainder is the leftover from a division problem
Do you agree
Touchdown
Sit down
The remainder is a number that is leftover and cannot fit in the divisor evenly
Touchdown
Sit down
A remainder is what is left after you do a division problem
Touchdown
A remainder is the leftover number it cannot be greater than the divisor
Excellent
Thank you
Please sit down
You may erase your board
What were some of the things you heard that were common among the definitions
This time I will take some hands
What were some things you heard about what is a remainder that youre like Ive heard that a couple times or I think this is whats true about remainders
Logan start us please
I know a remainder is something that is
I think  seven times  and they are  leftovers  divided by
Thank you
Liza
A remainder is like a small  divisor and you cant divide
What is it
You cant divide  the divisor
Any more times evenly
Right
After you do a division problem its whats left from a quotient
So A little extra amount that cant go into the divisor evenly
Thank you so much
You may put your hands down
Ms Dover lets look at the next board
Okay
I want to hear all of your voices and I want you to really pay attention to whats in blue because this is the success criteria
Youre going to think yourself This is what I need to do in my problems today
Okay my friends Ill know youre with me if your pencils and markers are down and your eyes are on the screen
Ready
Ready
I want to hear your voices
Go
Go
I will be successful when I draw a picture write the number model decide what to do with the remainder and explain my thinking
Excellent
Next slide
This is our math message
I would like for you to please stand up
I would like for you to please come to the carpet and sit where you can see the screen and start thinking for this problem
You have five seconds to be at the carpet
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Bring your whiteboard
Four
Four
Three
Two
Please get your whiteboards
Ill give you three more seconds because Mrs Travers was not clear
Three
Two
One
Zero
All right
If you are wearing red or maroon raise your hands
If you are wearing red or maroon youre going to read this problem out loud for our class
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Three children
What is each childs share
Id like you to solve this on your whiteboard and do some covering so that I see what youre thinking is not your neighbors
Remember our success criteria
How would you draw it
In fact Ms Dover can you go back
Yes
Yes
Draw a picture and write a number model and decide what to do with the remainder
Draw show it with the drawing decide what to do with the remainder and write a number model
Go
Go
Drawing number model
Think about the remainder
Drawing number model
Think about the remainder
Your thinking is amazing
I love how youre seeing so many different ways to solve
Now here at the carpet and this is not your thinking partner for the day but I would like you to turn your bodies right now so that you are facing someone and you have a thinking partner for just a minute
Just a minute
If you need to have a team of three thats okay too
Okay
Would you please show me by highfiving or fistbumping who are you talking with about this problem
Aiden can you join right here with Charlotte or are you with Owen
Owen who are you with
Fistbump someone so we know who youre with
Okay
Aiden why dont you join Ezra and Dylan
Owen there you go
You guys get three
You guys get two
So first thing what is this problem asking and how did you draw it
Talk to your partner both partners take a turn
Go
Go
What is this problem asking
All right
Please close your conversations
Now that weve talked about what does your picture look like and what is this asking now I want us to go with what is each childs share
That means how many cars does each child get
You already talked about that with your partner now
Go
Go
Three
Two
One
Zero voices please
Now my friends please turn all of your bodies until youre facing the easel
That means I can see your beautiful and handsome faces right here
Thank you
I saw a lot of different ways to solve but this is the way that makes sense to me
We have 16 cars and we have three kids
I need to divide these cars up equally and see how many cars each kid gets
Would somebody help me Hannah can you tell me how did you divide that
How did you do the division
each other
Okay
So you started with what
I started with 16
Then
Divided by
Divided by three
Three because there are three children
You did the problem like this
So 16 divided by three
I know three goes into 16 how many times
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
So that would be
Five times three is 15 with a remainder of one
Thats our division problem but I need to figure out the cars dont we
Does that mean each kid gets five cars
Yes
Im going to do this
Heres five cars
They go to this front
One
Two
Three
Four
Four
Five cars goes to this front
What does this front get
How many
Five
One
Two
Three
Four
Four
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Uhoh theres one leftover
The Mommy can have it
Does that make sense because theres one leftover down here
Yes
Does our drawing represent our algorithm our problem
Yes
Okay
Do we think we did this right
What are we going to do with this leftover car
You cant do it
The window
Well what do you think we should do
Oh my gosh
I heard Logan say this
Should we break it into three pieces so each kid gets 13 of a car
No
What should we do
Give it to mom
out the window
Ms Dover can you go back to our success criteria
What do I have to show to make sure I got what I need to get
Okay
I will be successful when I draw a picture
Did I do that
Yes
You need a number model
I need to do a number model
Sixteen divided by what
Three
Equals
Five remainder one
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Remainder one
and theres one car left over
I think what Im going to do so that its fair for each kid because it said equal shares Im going to say each kid gets
Five and one third
five cars
There will be one car left over and were going to ignore that one because its not fair for someone to get an extra car or you cant divide a car up into pieces
So please put your hands down for a second
This is how I would explain that
Questions or comments now
Did you have a question honey
Yes
Yes
I thought you can give the leftover cars to a number of kids
You could but what is our problem asking
Ms Dover will you read that
What is each
Childs share
Thats what its asking
So of these three children how many cars do each of these kids get
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Five
Thats what its asking
And because the keyword here since she highlighted it cars 16 toy cars equally
She knows she has to interpret the remainder
I cant really do anything with that remainder
So Im going to ignore it
If it was something like a pizza could I divide it into pieces divided it into fractions like thirds
But its not
Its a car
Im not going to give a piece of a car to a kid
No because then you would break then it would be useless so
My friends can you put your hands down
We can keep going theres more for me to show you and well come back to these ideas
Okay
Ms Dover
Oh my gosh
Look at that my friends
Turn and face the screen
Yes
Yes
There she is
There she is
If you are
Okay
Listen
You may erase your board
MsDover I dont have my eraser
Would you please hold up your hand if your shirt has blue on it today
My friends that have blue on your shirts and thats me too
just leave those side conversations
Okay
Blue shirts were reading
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Ms Dover has 18 to buy notebooks that costs 4 each
How many can she buy
How many can she buy
Were going to have some quiet thinking time
Can you flip back Ms Dover to success criteria again
Here we go
We need to make sure we draw a picture write a number model decide what to do with the remainder and do a little explaining of our thinking
Back to the problem
Theres your lovely Ms Travers
Show me on your whiteboard
You have one minute of writing and thinking time
Go
Go
Im seeing drawings
Im seeing division problems
Im seeing the letter R that stands for remainder
Im seeingSSsolving division problems and getting a quotient with a remainder
Were going to share in about 30 seconds so be ready to share something
Be ready to share how did you draw your picture how did you solve what was your number model how did you explain
Get ready to share one of those
Put your hands down please
when I call on one student guess who does the thinking
One student
When you talk in partners who does the thinking both partners all across our room
Thats why you do that
Please turn and face the same partner or trio that you were just in
The longer hair is speaking first
Your sentence is I did blank
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
So I did
At first I
Okay
Shorter haired person please share
Im not sure Im happy that Suria came on to that idea
Please close your conversations in three two one zero voices
Thanks for those brilliant ideas
Aiden Im going to ask you to do something quick for me
Would you please stand up
Would you please stand up
Would you please point to the blue writing the blue highlighted
Would you read that for us
How many can she buy
How many can she buy
How many can she buy
Thats what youre answering
I want you to look at your board right now
Is it very clear to me
Is it very clear to your partner
How many notebooks canT2buy
Remember you need a drawing a number model and an explanation
Look at your board right now
You would say something like Ms Dover can buy blank notebooks
Drawing number model explanation and is it really clearT2can buy how many notebooks can she buy
Ms Dover can buy how many notebooks
do you have a sentence that says Ms Dover can buy how many notebooks
Ms Dover  four cannot be divided to 18
Oh I want you to think
Remember whats the question were answering
All I want to know is how many notebooks can she buy
She can buy four notebooks with a remainder of two
Two what
Two dollars
Shell have 2 left
How many notebooks can she buy
Four
How many
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Awesome job
Im hearing you say she will have a remainder
Whats the remainder
Two dollars
Two dollars leftover
Two dollars leftover
Zoe can you tell us what you have please
and have remainder of two
She has a remainder of two what
Dollars
Two dollars shell have leftover
How many notebooks can she buy
Four
Four
Four
Mrs Travers we talked a little bit yesterday especially when youre doing problems like this
You have to be really clear what your answer is because we did have some practice problems and remember I told you guys that some of your  I didnt know what your answer was because it wasnt clear
So make sure  that youre using the units like Mrs Travers keep saying Two what
Two dollars leftover
Two dollars leftover
How many notebooks
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Does that make sense
Because otherwise we just want you to be super clear because even if you did the problem the right way but you didnt explain it then theres no  wrong
You will not even get a three
You will not get a three if you are not explaining the what and the why
Everybody checkT2can buy how many notebooks
Four
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Four notebooks
Two dollars left
She will have what leftover
Two dollars
Left
Two dollars left
Do I have a Ms Dover can you mouse us back to the success criteria because I think I still might be missing something on mind and I want to make sure theyre not missing anything on there
Were missing the picture
Okay
Did I draw a picture
No
No
So I need my dollars 18 dollars
These are my dollars 18 and each notebook is 4
Thats one notebook two notebooks three notebooks four notebooks and thats whats left
Did I have a drawing
Did I write a number model
Did I decide what to do with the remainder
No
She will have what
2 left
Thats my remainder
Shes just going to leave it
She has 2 left
Did I explain my thinking
One more Ms Dover
All right
My friends would you please erase your board and stand up
Please erase your boards and stand up
Ms  shell have to use the extra
I love so much how many of you are standing here with the zero voice ready to learn
Can I have everybody please take two or three steps backwards so we have a little bit of a semicircle around the board
Please continue facing the board
There we go
Lets read this in a deep voice
I want to hear your deep voices
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Mr Miller has 29 Poke mon cards
He can fit six cards on each page of his book
How many pages must he use to hold all 29 Poke mon cards
Quiet thinking
This is your think time
It is not a talking time
What is
Think about it
What is your number model going to be
How many pages will he use
Please sit back down and solve
sat right down and  go into town right now
So youre going make sure youre really looking at your answer
We want a picture
We want a number model
We want to know what the answer is with a unit
We want to know what to do with the remainder
Something else I want you to see is the really amazing thinking that other kids are doing
So do not erase
Do not erase
Were going to do something called a gallery walk in a minute so you can see how so many kids have solved this in different ways but first were going to talk together
I want to see you sitting knee to knee so that you can look into your partners eyes and you can really listen to how your partner solved
Please turn your body so youre sitting knee to knee with who youre talking to
Ready
Ready
If you have the lightercolored shoes you are speaking and sharing your thinking first
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Okay
Other partner make sure you are responding and sharing your work
Go
Go
Please close your conversations in three two one and zero
The rest of this time we will be looking and sharing a little bit in a different way
Im going to ask you to go to your desk put your whiteboard on your desk and stand behind your chair
Go
Go
Put your whiteboard on your desk and stand behind your chair
This one
I love how Lets see who is ready
is ready
is ready
Okay
With the zero voice when you go to a museum Excuse me
Excuse me
Thank you
When you go to a museum we have something called a gallery walk where you really look and study whats on the wall or whats in the exhibit
I want you to go study how your classmates solved
Ms Dover may you go back to the success criteria
Again see how many times Im going to this
This is how important it is
Ready
Ready
I want you to look at the picture
Did a classmate make the same kind of picture or different
I want you to look at the number model and I want you to look at what is the answer
What did this person do with the remainder
Then were going to come back together and see who we agreed with and which examples do we feel like met all of the success criteria
Okay
You will not be talking
You were going to just here in a museum
Look at whatT2is doing
Youre going to walk by someones work and youre really going to study it and youre not going to say a word
Then youre going to walk by someone else and youre really going to study it
Did they meet the success criteria
Did you get the same answer
Then youre going to move on
There is no talking
Ready
Ready
You have one minute to gallery walk
Go
Go
Would you please come back to the carpet
Do not bring anything
You have five seconds to come back to the carpet
Go
Go
Mine is called me
to me because in math revising our thinking is how we learn and get better
Theres no such thing as a bad answer in math
Please dont talk to me like that
All right my friends is this the number model most of you had 29 divided by six
Yes
Mr Miller has 29 cards and he can fit six cards on a page
Right or no
Yes
Yes
Yes
Okay
So drawing like this is one way actually making the pages
This is another way
I saw
Okay
Let me hold
There we go
There we go
Thank you
This is another way I saw kids draw
I need to make it a little smaller
I see 29 Poke mon cards six on a page
One two three four five book pages
This one says he would have one spare left for another card
Twentynine divided by six equals five remainder one
Okay
What about this
Heres pages six on a page six 12 18 24 25 26 27 28 29 remainder 3
Mr Miller must use five pages of his book and there will be three Poke mon leftover
What I really want you to notice is that there are different ways to solve and this
We have 29 cards divided by six
The division problem is that theres four pages and theres a remainder of two cards left
You can put 24 cards on four pages with the remainder of two
My friends Im not telling you which one is right or wrong showing you that there are a lot of different ways to solve
Im going to rely on you right now
Were going to go back to what is your thinking
Go back to Mr Miller
What is this asking you to solve for
Owen
Its asking me to  how many pages he can use  all 29 Poke mon cards
How many pages
How many pages
Because some people said four remainder two but when he said All that means all the cards
Twentynine cant go
We have to use all cards
We have 29 cards
Can you turn your bodies this way please
We have 29 cards and we know were going to put them on six pages
Right
I mean six cards and what we want to know is how many pages
Right
How many pages
How many pages
This is really important Were trying  answers about pages
I have a lot of kids drawing the pages one page two page three pages
Lets see
I dont know how many pages well need
How many go on a page
Six
Six cards on a page
Six Count with me
Six 12 18 24 30
Twentyeight
Thirty
Its 30
Count with me
Count with me
Six12 18 24 25 26 27 28 29
There would be a little extra room on this page but Kenley whats the important word
All
Is it Kenley
Did I call your sisters name
Yes
Its okay
Ms Rosenberg did
Does she do it too
Oh my gosh
And Ms  and Ms Rosenberg
Oh my gosh
I just
Its okay
I know who you are
Okay
So my friends how many pages do we need
One
Two
Count with me
Count with me
One
Two
Three
Four
Four
Five pages
Our answer is going to be something like Mr Miller needs what
Five pages
Is to fit all his Poke mon cards but he will have one left
But he will have one extra space
Fit all of the cards
all cards
There will be one space leftover but this gets us to 29
Do I have everything I need for success criteria or am I missing anything
Whats missing
Did I draw a picture
Yes
It might need some label
This is cards
You need to explain
This is a page
We need to explain
Write a number model
My new number model would be 29 divided by six equals what
Five
What
A remainder
Four remainder of five but youll have an extra page to
Mr Miller needs five pages to fit all of the cards
Since 29 divided by six equals four remainder 5 there are five cards left to go on the next page
Your comments or feedback for me Ms  while I write
Yes
Feedback
Did you explain what to do with the remainder
Did I explain what to do with the remainder friends
Look up here
Did I
Yes
I need your eyes
Yes
Between this and this did I explain it
Mr Miller needs five pages to fit all the cards
Since 29 divided by six equals four remainder 5 this five is this
There are five cards left to go on the next page
So this means we need
Five
Would that make it more clear
Yes
Because you always have to be thinking Is my answer clear
Maybe  but maybe I need
So he needs how many pages does he need
Five
Five pages to fit all of the cards
Does that make sense
Is that better
Thank you for your help
Did I meet my success criteria
Yes
Youre going to go try some now
My friends I have to get going
I know
SoT2and were really going to leave this up to you if you want them to do shoulders thinking partners if you want to just have them partner or do sage and scribe everything always takes longer than this is heard
Thanks
But my friends dont you think we did a really good job practicing
Yes
Your job now is I think theres not very many problems on the pages
Its like four or five columns
Its not very many
What youre going to be doing is for each problem draw it write a number model decide what to do with the remainder and explain your thinking
Thank you for having me today
Lets stand up and do one more four four eight before I go
Would you please stand up
Would you please stand up
Wait
Actually head back to your seats and stand up at your desks
Ladies and gentlemen thank you for showing me youre ready
You are going to breathe in for four hold for four breathe out for eight
Remember we do this because when our brains have oxygen oxygen helps our brains work in their best way
Ready
Ready
Breathe in for four hold out for eight
Take a couple of regular breaths please
If youre not interested in doing this I cant make you but please dont ruin this nice time for your classmates
Just stand still if youre not interested
Okay
Breathe in through your nose hold it for four and slowly breathe out
Mrs Travers Im going to allow some
