Okay we are going to start this morning with our morning warmup and these problems might look familiar to you they are from the exit slip we did the other day and I choose these because 80 90 of the class got ones or twos on the exit slip
Okay so if you are like I got this theres a good chance that you got a one or two so I really want you to think of the strategies that we used
What were the strategies that we used
Talk with your shoulder partner please what were the strategies that we did subtraction
Five four three two and one
Colin what do you remember about the strategies that we learned
Yes we learned was that we split in half the shape so subtract
Okay in order to split a shape in half what did you have to do
Think about it use my cards
What did you have to do first to split a shape in half
Gianna
The first thing that we have to do was find  and then we can find what the progression is
Kind of
In order to split a shape I have to have a shape right
What did you do to have a shape to split
Amy
I think I wasnt the only one there was
Abel in order to have a shape you have to do something what did you have to do
Like take the denominator and split it and the
I cant split something I dont have you guys are jumping ahead quite a bit yes
You need to label it
I cant label something I dont have
You have to split both  like this is like a part here and a part here
I dont have any parts of anything  youre on the right track of what we do but were all forgetting what we did first and emphasizing this because Im sorry to interrupt Rose Im emphasizing this because on your exit slip very few people even tried to use the strategy in the class Maddie
You have to draw a picture
You have to draw a picture then we can split and do everything that Rose is telling us and Colin was telling and whoever else I called on was telling us
First you have to draw a picture there were only about six people in the class who drew a picture on the exit slip and then there were only about one or two of those six people who drew a picture for both of them and then I could see that some people drew a picture but were confused which is why we are doing this warmup today
What I want you to do I want you to start with the strategy of drawing a picture and I want you to just solve this first one go
Everybody
Why do I hear talking
Were not working with our partner right now
We have a picture for this
