Okay we should be good
We have it seems forgotten where place value is
I look around I see a whole bunch of people who have this answer which is incorrect
So let s do a little review of place value
I know that my chart is covered but to be honest with you place value Bryson is something that you guys especially for the whole numbers should be experts at and have memorized
Then by now in fifth grade you should have this memorized too
Because  we can t use those place value charts
Josiah please cap your marker
I don t want to see you wasting the ink again
Mr Evan would you mind handing me my book and my cards that are right there
Here is my decimal
Turn to someone close to you
What is the place to the left of the decimal
Tell them
It s not a whole number
It has a place value
It has a place
It is a whole number but it has a place
Okay what is to the left Lennox
What place is this
The ones
Okay
Then Ellie what s this one
Tenth
Not tenths
There s a huge difference there friends
You have to both listen and write it in order to get the right Phoenix what s here
sorry
Lea is also
what s here
The tenths place
Notice the THS
Tell your partner what does the THS signal when you hear it
What does it signal
Tell your partner please
and a pencil
Okay
Five four three two and one
Actually leave the pencil
Nate what does the THS signal
at the right of the decimal
Exactly
That means it is a place value to the right of the decimal
It is a place value that is smaller than one
Smaller than a whole
Class what comes next after tenths
Hundredths
Again it s got that THS
I said we have a nine in the tenths place
Take a look at this
Does this have a nine in the tenths place
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
My friends who said no please refer to the place value chart that I just wrote
The tenth is to the right of the decimal
One place value to the right there is a nine so that one is correct
Then I said there is a seven in the ones place
Is there a seven in the ones place
No
Where is the seven
In the hundredths
In the hundredths place
One strategy I did notice Bryson did this strategy some of others of you might have but I noticed very few people is to put these spots in
Then you said okay there is a nine in the tenths place there is a seven in the ones place and there is a one in the hundredths place
Is there a one in the hundredths place in this one
No
What place value is the one in
Ones
The hundredths is the second from the right
Now I found it interesting that both of my friends who shared said all the words correctly but did not put them in place correctly
Place value is important
You have to understand place value in order to do more complex math
All right let s try another one
If I don t have the chart handy then you have to figure out how to solve that problem
Could you write this on your own board as a reference from your memory
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
If you don t remember it should you maybe get on  Academy and do some place value work or study that
Yes
Yes okay
Then you When I read it twice you should doublecheck your work
The first time Nora maybe you put in your lines and you fill them in
Then the second time I read it then you re doublechecking is that in the right spot
All right so my second one
I have an eight in the thousandths place a three in the tenths place a five in the tenths place and a six in the hundredths place
I will read that again
Hold on I m going to read it one more time
Sorry
An eight in the thousandths place a three in the tenths place a five in the tenths place and a six in the hundredths place
Could you put the marker up on the counter right there and then only when it s time to write and you grab it and write
Mila grab the mic
My pen is next to my computer
Write what you have
Share your thinking
Use the mic friends
I did this number because
What number is that
30 and 568
Almost
Who can coach Mila
What is the one thing she s missing when she read that number
Go ahead and  number
What
You forgot to say what  the place value
Oh thousandths
Say the whole thing again
30 and 568 thousandths
Perfect
Now class say that number
Thank you
It s been a while since we practiced
Go ahead
And  say tenths is three
I put a zero because it had to be something next to  so I put a zero
Then she said tenths
She said put a five in the tenths and then a six in the hundredths and eight in the thousandths
All right
I really like how Mila put a zero as a place holder
Because if you used these lines to help you and you put the three in the tenths and you had the five here you noticed there is a place value in the middle of the two numbers that s blank
We can never have blank
Zero means nothing is there
Now my friends who wrote this my guess is you did not use the strategy of the two lines and you wrote the three but what place value does this three have
What place value does this three right here have
It does not have the tens
Let s take a look at our chart
It is one number next to the decimal point which makes it ones
If you wrote it the first time and then doublechecked your answer the second time you might see Whoa this isnt the ones
I did something wrong
So make sure youre doing that doublechecking
Our last problem
Come over to my book again erase your number
I have a two in the hundreds place a four in the thousandths place and a seven in the tenths place
What number am I
I have a two in the hundreds place
Listen carefully because a very small change in what I say changes place value
A four in the hundredths place and a seven in the Sorry a four in the thousandths place
Sorry about that
And a seven in the tenths place
Because I misspoke Ill read it one more time just so were clear
Two in the hundreds place four in the thousandths place and a seven in the tenths place
I got 200 and 740 thousandths because you said at first a two in the  and then you said a four in the thousandths place
There is a two and four and you said the last number is seven in the tenths so I put a seven
Then you didnt say anything else so I filled in the blanks with zeros
Now I noticed most students improving
The couple that I saw Ron had the two in the hundredths place and I tried to be really clear in emphasizing that I said hundreds not hundredth
I tried to be really obvious with that
So you have to listen carefully because the difference is just that TH All right boys and girls
Today were going to be Hold on
Today were going to be working on some word problems or a word problem
I have a little bit of learning to do before we start the word problem
This is one of those twoday pieces
Where the first day we solve the problem and then the second day I look at common errors and we get to improve our problem for our grade
Ill take a volunteer because I left my cards over there and I dont feel like making my way back
Friend can you cap your marker please and put it down
Thank you
I can solve a question number  by interpreting
Interpreting
interpreting a drawing that  I cant say it
Situation
All right so the word interpreting is highlighted
What does interpret mean
What does interpret mean
Talk chat with your partner please
What does interpret mean
Five four three two and one
What do you think Tayden
I think it means that you guess
Okay
Wheres my active listening
Hannah what do you think
To convince someone
Convince
We have guess we have convince
Phoenix what do you think
Like make or
Make
Okay so we have convince guess and make
And Ill say none of the above
Interpret means to understand
When were interpreting something we are trying to understand or figure out the meaning
My friends who say Thats what I said good
That means you had it right
You dont need to announce it to theSSthough or you could raise your hand and say when we heard three answers that you disagreed with you could raise your hand and say I think something different
When we interpret something we understand or figure out the meaning
Please tell your partner what does interpret mean
Go
Go
In a little bit youre going to hear a story problem that has to do with fractions and you are going to have to make a drawing to model the situation and then figure out or understand what that drawing and what is going on with the situation
I know I can do this when Class read the first one
Show
What does that mean that you need to do if youre showing
Rory
We need to show like make a picture of how much they took and then Yes
You can show with a picture
Can we show with anything else other than a picture
Yes we could show with You mean like words
Yes
You could show with words
Could we show with numbers
Yes
We could show with numbers
Now according to our target we have a drawing here
I think Rory we definitely need to do what Rory said which is the picture piece but we also will have to do those other two pieces too
All right when I point to it read the next success
Whats a number model
Chat with your partner
Five four three two and one
whats a number model
A number model is showing what youre adding or subtracting or multiplying
Okay so a number model is going to be a number some sort of operation and then another number
The number model is the actual problem that were doing
I see a number model over there
Today yes youre going to have to do a picture but youre also going to have to give a number model to show what that picture represents all right
When I point read
When I point read
All right so explain
Boys and girls what do I need to use when I explain
Words
Words
And what kind of words
Yes
Yes
Yes
Then the final one which actually should be the first one because before you can do all of this stuff you have to do this right here
Were actually going to spend some time today on this part before we solve it
When I point read
When I point read
Weve been doing this part for a while
Today Im really wanting to emphasize this part
Because a lot of you are annotating and youre underlining and then you still have no clue what the question is asking
If youre just underlining a bunch of stuff and calling it a day because Ms  wants to see underlining but thats not the point
The point of annotating which by the way is underlining plus words the point of annotating is figuring out what is this problem asking me to do
And that is a continued issue so were going to spend some time with strategies for that today
Youre basically annotating right now
I am arent I
Good point
Good point pointing that out friend
All right
I dont want to spend a ton of time on this because this is a bit confusing in and of itself but before we start our lesson today I want to talk about another point of confusion
And it is confusing
The fifth grade teachers were debating this yesterday when we were having our plan time the fifth grade teachers were debating that poster
Im not having you write down notes for it
Ill put the poster back there so you can take a look at it
I want to talk about before we start looking at our problem today whats the difference between fraction multiplication and fraction subtraction
Because theyre very very easy to mix up
Yes
Yes
Yes
For a fraction was it addition
Pardon
Was it addition
Addition
Well addition doesnt seem
Subtraction
Subtraction
Subtraction
I was like Doesnt seem as confusing
Subtraction you have to find a common denominator
For multiplication you dont have to find a common denominator and you can just multiply the denominators
I agree
When we are doing a subtraction problem Im going to ask that you put your marker up on this table until it is time to use it
Thank you
When we are actually doing the problems like Kevin has said we find a common denominator to subtract
Then multiplication we just multiply across
What is confusing to lots of students is when you have a word problem when do we subtract
When do we multiply
So I have this poster here to help us
When you are subtracting you are taking away
This is where it gets confusing because when youre multiplying in a way youre taking away but the question is  differently
The keywords are going to be really important in figuring out do I subtract or do I multiply
What keywords do we see here
Lets try that again with the wholeSSparticipating
Because until I gave you a hint on that constructed response we did on Wednesday everybody was subtracting and Im not going to give you a hint forever
Im not going to give you a hint today Im not going to give you a hint on CMAS so its really important that you guys can interpret these questions and what to do without me hinting
So lets try that again
What keywords do we look for for subtraction
For example if I have a half of the pizza and Seth ate a third more of the pizza and the question is how much is left that would be a subtraction problem because its asking how much is left of the pizza
How much remains of the pizza
What is the difference between what I ate and what Seth ate
Those keywords help with subtraction
When were doing multiplication its so similar so I get why its confusing
Its part of a part or part of a whole
Weve got that one up there 46 times 12 thats part of a whole
What is 46 of 12
The keyword here is of
What is tricky is sometimes youre going to see of in an adding problem a division problem a subtraction problem
So you have to really be careful that youre thinking Okay whats it asking
Is it asking for 14 of 34
Is it asking for a fraction of a fraction or a fraction of a whole
Does the question ask for the whole unit
I might say I ate a third of the pizza
Seth ate half of what I ate
How much of the pizza did Seth eat
Because were asking for how much of the whole pizza Ellie were going to multiply were not going to subtract
Whereas if I were to say How much of the pizza is left
Thats a keyword for subtraction
Were going to subtract were not going to multiply
This is really key here is the question the answer asking for the fraction related to the whole
Again were going to look at some problems really quickly and Im going to ask you to stand up so we can get a little bit of movement
Put yourself to the side and stand up
Can you pass me the  right there
Im going to ask you if it is a multiplication problem to go stand on that side of the room
If it is a subtraction problem to stand on this side of the room
If it is neither multiplication or subtraction youre going to stand in the back
Point where do you stand for multiplication
Subtraction
Subtraction
Neither
Subtraction
Subtraction
Neither
Subtraction
Subtraction
Neither
Subtraction
Subtraction
Multiplication
Neither
Okay
If youre confused then what can you do
Ask somebody
Ask a question
Seth hands are to ourselves
All right
I am going to read the question and it is up here and youre going to share with me what do you think by moving your bodies this question is asking
Is it asking you to multiply
Is it asking you to subtract
Or is it asking you neither of those two operations which means division or addition
Thinking of what we just had on the poster no I dont expect you to be an expert but you can look at that
Thats multiply
Sorry multiplication because thats what were working on
Multiplication subtraction neither
All right so we dont have an agreement here
Were all mixed up
Every part has other people so take about 30 seconds right now to talk with others in your group about why are you there
So when I pull your card youre ready
Go
Go
Five four three two one
I heard Because
I want to hear very clear specific sentences
I think multiplication because
I think neither because
I think subtraction because
Go
Go
Okay five four three two and one
I see some people changing their mind
You can change your mind as long as you can explain why
Josiah share your thinking
Where are you at Josiah first of all
At the neither
It doesnt tell you
But it does tell you what operation in the clues of the problem
You have to do something
This is a real word problem
In fact on a test youre going to be taking probably in a week or so before spring break theres a problem almost exactly like this on it
How do you know
Because I made the test
Okay so it does tell us
Josiah my question is thinking about what I see here do you see any of the fraction or the subtraction keywords like left difference or remain Josiah
No
Pardon
No
No
No
No subtraction keywords
All right Im going to throw it to my subtraction friends here
Josiah said he didnt see subtraction keywords so tell me why do you think its subtraction
I think its subtraction because its saying what fraction of theSShas glasses
So that s subtracting I think
Are we taking something away
Boys
No
No
No
And do we see any of those keywords there
So its not subtraction
Were down to either multiplication or neither
You guys need to make a choice based on what that saying where are you going to join
Im going to put this over here
Somebody grab it who thinks they can share
Thank you
For zeros
I think its multiplication because of keywords like of and of is a keyword of multiplication
It s also asking how much glasses of the
How many
How many glasses girls wear
How much glasses
How many
How many glasses girls wear
Okay I want everyone to come back to the rug
I want you to sit or squat just so everybody can see the problem but were going to be getting up again so dont make yourself too comfortable
Friends I shouldnt need to wait so long
This problem is multiplication and as we look at our poster there there is some really big hints
First of all weve already talked about how theres nothing about subtraction
So that one should have been written off right away
Were not taking anything away and there are no keywords that show subtraction
Now I see the word of right here
Heres another one of
We have 25 girls thats a part and then we have 18 of those girls
See how these are both girls
That shows me Im looking for a part of a part
That makes it a fraction of the problem
Another clue that its multiplication is the question says how much of the whole class
And when its fraction of a clue is that the answer is what fraction of the actual whole
Even though this question isn t about boys its still asking what fraction of the whole class
Another thing I should probably add to my poster in figuring out is that when were looking for part of a part were looking for that same unit
That helps us know were doing part of a part
Yes
Yes
Yes
Well it also says of again
Youre right
18 of the girls and this is showing us its that same unit
Its that I am looking for girls with glasses out of all the girls of the class
Then the question is of the whole class
Those are all the clues that helped me know its multiplication
With your partner I want you to paraphrase
What are the clues that helped you know its multiplication so we can recognize them if there are more multiplication problems
Go
Go
Okay waterfall
Heres a new one
A farm is in the shape of a rectangle 18 of a mile long and 25 of a mile wide
What is the area of the farm
Rory where are you at
Take a moment
Were unanimous it looks like but take a moment to chat with somebody close to you because I might choose your card
Why do you think this problem is multiplication
I want  Stop
I want to hear a complete sentence the problem is multiplication because
Go
Go
All right friends
Amy why multiplication
I think multiplication because it says of and thats one of the keywords for multiplication
Then for area you have to multiply
Whats the formula for area
Width times length
Perfect
I think that is the biggest key
As soon as you saw this word area length times width Im multiplying
Nice
Come on back so you can see the next problem
A pizza is cut into eight slices
There is 15 of the pizza
If Jamie eats another slice 18 of the original whole pizza which fraction of the original pizza is left over
Im working your thigh muscles then with that up and down
Okay it looks like were unanimous again so chat really quickly so youre ready to share
Why do you think subtraction
Waterfall
Its one or the other
Ellis whats your thinking
My thinking is I think it s subtraction because it says left over at the end of the problem
You are correct
Now Josiah is pointing something out
He is saying that it says of so we have 25 of a pizza
Then he eats another slice which is 18 of the original pizza
I emphasized that and maybe I sounded silly in emphasizing it but I emphasized it for a purpose
Remember this one was both girls girlsgirls
This is not part of a part
This says 18 back to that original pizza
It doesnt say 18 of that pizza he ate
So thats a difference
Then of course the kicker is what Ellis said
The question asked leftover thats a subtraction keyword
All right next one
In Sams fifth Why dont we just freeze where we are and listen and if you need to pause and read it you can
In Sams fifthgrade class 18 of the students are boys
Of these boys 25 have red hair
What fraction of theSSis redhaired boys
All right were almost unanimous but not quite
Bryson whats your thinking
I think its multiplication because it says of at the end of the problem
Okay I need more though because this problem also said of so that cant be our only clue
Lennox what other clue
It says What fraction of the class
Okay so what about that is a clue
Its a fraction of the
Okay so weve got a fraction of the class
Thats referring to the whole
Then if I look at this I have 18 boys and then I have 25 of those boys again
Just like the girl problem were looking at part of a part or a part of a part
Yes it does say what fraction of theSSand fraction of problems are multiplication
Were going to do one more Actually theres two more
Alex was planting a garden
He planted 25 of the garden with potatoes and 18 of the garden with lettuce
What fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce
Can we be respectful of peoples stuff on the ground
Watch where were walking when its crowded with stuff
All right we have a little bit of a difference here
Sage why are you where youre at
Im in this one because
Whats this one
The none of them because it says that he planted 25 of the garden its kind of dividing it
Like you have to figure out the fraction of it like just a fraction
Okay
Well if youre figuring out what fraction of multiplication is fraction of
So what youre saying might support multiplication
Remember division is dividing into equal parts
Are they dividing it into equal parts
Josiah please stop disturbing our learning
I asked a classmate a question give him the think time
Are we dividing into equal parts
No
My friends all here in the middle the middle is nothing
You have to choose a side please
You either are back against the counter Conor or youre over here because I cant tell where you are right now
Youre just hanging out in no mans land
All right
Lea where are you at
What do you think
Im at multiplication because its asking what fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes or lettuce
I know its not subtraction because youre not subtracting
Natalie are you listening to your classmate
youre not subtracting it but I dont think youre not dividing it or doing either of them
I think its multiplication because its asking how much of the garden is planted with the potatoes or lettuce
I think its  you how much youre planting
Okay
Let me throw it to someone else over here whos in the neither
Weve got an argument for multiplication
She said she sees the word of and its asking for fraction of the garden
what do you think
I think its neither and maybe addition because it says he planted 25
Boys stop it
with potatoes and 18 of the garden with lettuce
What fraction of the garden is planted with potatoes and lettuce
When it says that it seems like their adding both of them to figure out in total how many potatoes and lettuce there is in the garden
All right so I saw some people switch sides
You shouldnt have
Friends this is the trickiest question of them all because it really has a lot of clues that look like multiplication
It says this it says of and it says what fraction of the garden
However theres one important thing that shows that its not multiplication
This is 25 of potatoes
This is 18 of lettuce
A part of a part has to be the same girls and girls boys and boys mile and mile
Are these the same
Lettuce and potatoes
No
No theyre not the same so it cannot be multiplication
As  said it is asking for the total of potatoes and lettuce
So it is an addition problem
Yes
Yes
Yes
Is of always interpreted as multiplication in problems like
What has this shown you
Is it always
No
No
No
Thats why its so important  to understand what is going on in the question
You cant just say I see the word of
I see this word
That means that we multiply because I see of because it says fraction of
You have to understand what is the question really asking
You have to look at the big picture
This had tons of multiplication keywords but it wasnt asking for the part of the part because these are two different things
I cant do multiplication for two very different things
Thats not what multiplication means
If we think of our area model we were splitting one thing into parts right
Well these are two different things
I cant split them like that
Last one
The track at school is 25 of a mile long
If Jason has run 18 of a way around the track what fraction of a mile has he run
Ran
It says run
Shouldnt it be ran
Im pretty sure its supposed to say ran
Its not
My friends whispering I hope youre only whispering about why you are here and what told you it was subtraction
Rory
I think its subtraction because It doesnt have any keywords for subtraction but
Then what makes it subtraction
If it doesnt have any keywords what would make it subtraction
Are you changing your mind
Okay were going to freeze
I really like how Rory when he had to explain the why Natalie I asked you to freeze
That means you
That doesnt mean everybody but you
I like how when Rory was asked to explain he realized he was on the wrong side
I think we have some herd mentality here
There are no keywords that mean subtraction
Were not taking away
Its not asking for how much is left how much of the track does he have left to run
Its not asking for whats the remaining amount of the track
In fact weve got 25 of a mile and then 18 of a mile because its of the track and the track is 25 of a mile so thats part of a part
Then the question is what fraction of a mile which means that were asking for the answer in relation to the whole mile
Everything in this problem says multiplication
So in coming to the subtraction that shows me we dont have an understanding yet
Were not looking at the big picture and maybe we have some herd mentality Oh everyone is walking this way so will I
Grab your stuff and return to your seat please
You have 20 seconds to do so
