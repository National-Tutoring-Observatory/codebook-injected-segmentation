Were going to be continuing with our learning from the last couple of days
One thing I want to make sure I point out is that after our review on Friday you showed such a better understanding
Awesome awesome job especially that group that had tangles and worked with me for a while
It really paid off
As a class we did awesome on that exit slip
The number one issue on that exit slip that got people twos was that the problem was subtraction a lot of you added
What type of math error would that be when we look at silly mistake math mistake or process mistake
What type of math error do you think that would be
Think
Todd
I think it would be a silly mistake
I think so too
Total bummer that you got something wrong just because you didnt pay attention to the sign and you made an assumption of what the sign was because weve done more adding than subtracting
All right lets look at our success targets
Carrie
Daria
I dont know
Im
If one denominator is a multiple of the other
If it is it is also a common denominator
Lucy
Okay Im going to have you use this because Im seating two feet from you and I cannot hear you
Making a list of improper fractions
Weve already read that one and weve already read the second one
Were on the third one
Multiply by two or  product as a common denominator
Boys and girls each of you high five someone close to you
Lucy if you need a group of three well figure that out
Lets do Brett and Bailey Andrea and Remy Lucy and Leo and then Asher you can be a group of three either with these two or these two
You choose
Okay
Tell your partner what resource can you look at if you forgot over the weekend how to find common denominators for fractions
Tell your partner and you can show them too but use your words
Go
Go
Okay class
Point
Something very important that is missing from our success criteria that I want to make sure that you remember is steps three and four
Finding that equivalent fraction which is where a lot of people had their tangles
Youre showing really nice understanding of this piece but then struggled with finding the equivalent fraction but like I said from our exit slip most of those tangles were all worked out
Were going to start our lesson with a little video
As you watch this video be ready to share with your partner something new you have learned
Okay
Dear Tim and Moby what is a mixed number
From Dino 11
Well a mixed number is made up of a nonzero integer and a fraction
1 12 2 34 27 38 these are all examples of mixed numbers
Moby and I are working on a mixed number right now
Were supposed to add 2 12 liters of oil for the car 2 12 really means 2  12
Converting a mixed number to a fraction is just a matter of adding two fractions
Well look at 2 12
To add 2 and 12 we write 2 as a fraction with a denominator of 2
2 is the same thing as 42
Now adding them together is easy 42  12  52
A fraction like 52 with the numerator larger than the denominator is called an improper fraction
No theyre just called that
Theres a shortcut for converting mixed numbers to fractions
Yes how much oil do we have leftover
3 34 liters of oil
The shortcut is to multiply the whole number by the fractions denominator and then add the numerator to the result
We place that result over the denominator and get our improper fraction
4 x 3  12  3  15
15 over four 154
See Moby
Mixed numbers arent so tough
Moby
Maybe you should go easy on that stuff
That video was a review
What I would like you to do is either something new or something you forgot and you saw this you were like Yes I remember that
Okay
Go ahead and chat
Person with the longest hair please go first
Maybe you can pop down and sit right here in this corner while were here on the carpet
In that way you can work with a group or you can also talk to Mr Andrew
Five four three two and one
When I call your name I want you to tell me what your partner said not what you said
Take a moment to think about what your partner said or if you forgot ask them
Im going to give you about 15 seconds to do that
Okay so that buzz of conversation is valuable to me because it showed me how that we had a lot of students who when their partner talked tuned them out
Im going to be asking a lot more frequently and you never know when what did your partner say
Youve got to be listening to your partner
Joey
My partner said Well we both said pretty much the same thing
and then you add it to the numerator
What are you multiplying by the denominator
You multiply the denominator by what
There we go
Thank you for your awesome math vocabulary
I appreciate that math vocabulary I heard
Sorry Im not rewarding you with much but such is luck
All right so I didnt have you bring your math journal so Im going to put math journal page 160 up and youre going to use your whiteboard to record your answers okay
As youre going through this be ready to share because its about estimation
Again its a little bit of a review in which problems you were able to solve in your head
Were not doing anything with todays targets of finding the common denominators
This No this is the one with the answer
We dont want that
There we go
All right
Lets see how can we do this
Well just have to do it one at a time
Number one
You are going to write either half one or one and a one half on your whiteboard for its estimate
If you can solve this in your head without having to find common denominators and do that Im not asking you to go through that in your head because thats where youre going to make a mistake if youre like Okay what are the common denominators
No were not going to do that
If you can do this quickly in your head like this  youre going to write the answer
If you cant leave it blank and just write one of these
Number one lets take about 10 seconds
Please do not waste the time by rewriting the problem
The only thing you are writing is one of these numbers and if you can do it in your head quickly the answer
Youre not copying everything
My friends who just did that thank you for listening
Share with your partner
How did you find the estimate that I see on your board
Show me your thinking
All right
I see a mixture of half and one
Luis what was your estimate and how did you find it
Half
Lets speak in a complete sentence My estimate was
My estimate was half because
Now heres my question for you
How did you solve that mentally like that
I did
Then you werent supposed to solve it
If you had to go through those steps in your head I asked you not to solve it
Please make sure that you are following instructions friend because heres why
Heres why Ashley eyes on me Im being particular about that because estimating Julia is super important to see if your answer is reasonable or not
If you find the answer first and then estimate are you really estimating
No
No
No
What if you get the wrong answer
Does the estimate help you
If you use the answer to estimate
No
No
You always estimate first then solve
Now the correct answer is half
Who wants to share their thinking if they got half
Bailey
I know that
Okay and then what did you do to get your answer of half
I know that to get to half
Yes
The estimate of a half
I know two
Okay
All right
I think half is a better answer than one because I know that one fourth is half of a half
Does that make sense
If I think of my pie and I cut a piece in half and then I cut it in half again thats only half of a half
I know that two fifths is less than a half so if Im adding a half of a half and less than a half its going to be here not here
Let me draw a picture to show you what I mean
One fourth is half Heres half of a half
Does that make sense
Julia your eyes are here
Then two fifths I know and Bailey was saying like whats half of five
Two and a half right
Twofifths is going to be a little bit less
Im not drawing it totally accurate because this is just an estimate so its a little bit less
If I take a little bit less than a half plus that its not going to be closer to one its going to be closer to a half if I were to put these two pieces together
Any questions on that
Again the idea of estimation is that it happens in our head
All right number two I dont want you to write the answer
I only want you to write the estimate
Be ready to share with your partner how you found your estimate
10 seconds
Okay share with your partner
Whoever talked last time first zip it
Let your partner talk
Go
Go
Id love to see your talking with your partner
Waterfall
Anna explain your thinking and what your estimate was
Everyone show me your estimate real fast
Okay
Everyone seems to agree
Anna share your thinking and I want to see active listening thumb
Okay Ill put you back in my pile
Peyton share your thinking
I got one because
What did I say you could not do
Add them
Add them first
I said estimate dont add first
Share your thinking
If you didnt add them first how would you know that the answer is going to be close to one
Because they all have the same denominator and
Theres active listening thumb I saw up today
Share your thinking Cooper
I agree but not really because you didnt really explain
Then share your thinking
How would you get to one
How did you get the estimate of one
I looked at the denominator and
I want to clarify something right now because both people who shared out made that same mistake
The denominator does not tell you if its going to be close to one
Just because the denominator is the same doesnt mean its going to be close to one or a half or anything
Thats not what helps with the estimate
What helps with the estimate
What have I talked to you about before
Cooper
The numerator
The numerator yes and the relationship between the numerator and the denominator and thinking about what does that fraction Sebastian look like
If I would have pictured is a pizza what would it look like
Thats where were estimating estimating kind of shows you understand the value of the fraction and so from what Im hearing I see you have the right estimate but that we cant say it makes me wonder if you understand the value of each fraction so I want to you to think about a pizza with nine slices
Show me your thumbs up when youve got that image in your head
When we did estimating we were looking at these three numbers what is it closest to
One ninth
Look at one of those slices of pizza
Which of these numbers is it closer to
You can show me a zero you can show me half like this like a fraction line or you can show me one
One little slice of that ninth pizza what is it closer to having no pizza having half a pizza or having a whole pizza
Okay so I see most of you here at zero so we know this value is just a little bit
All right four ninths whats it closest to
Picture four pieces of pizza now
Half one or zero
Okay I see most people showing a half
What about three pieces of pizza whats that closer to half one or zero
You should not be waiting till I look at you to participate we should be thinking and participating
This is closer to half
If I have This is a little bit less than a half but close to a half
This is a little bit less but close to a half so I put that together
Ive already got over a half and this a little bit pushing me even closer to our answer of one
When we estimate we really want to think about the value
Now find the answer to the actual problem
Write it on your whiteboard
Show me your answer
Brett can you explain how you got your answer its okay just explain
I got eight ninths
I got eight ninths because firstly I did all the numerators so 4  3  7 and 7  1  8
Then the denominator stays the same so the eight ninths
Okay thank you active listening thumbs and I love your use of math vocabulary Brett
Is eight ninths close to one
Go picture that pizza again
I have eight slices do I have almost a whole pizza
No
Our estimate was correct
While Im switching screens share with your neighbor how come you could solve this problem quickly in your head but not this one
How come you could solve number two in your head quickly and not number three
One sorry
Anna what are you thinking
Because what
Number two and number were different problems
Why could you do this one in your head easier than the other one
is the question
Maya share your thinking
You can add the second problem in your head and not the first one because the second problem had the same denominators so you could just add it but the first problem had unlike denominators so you have to go through the whole process to get a common denominator
Very nice
Again great use of that math vocabulary
All right no that is skipping ahead too far
Okay take a look at this problem up here what do you notice about that problem
The first thing Im asking
Think
Share with your partner
Five four three two one
Anna what did you notice about that problem
The denominators is
sit down listen
and whoever added this and the denominator is
Okay and is that wrong or right class
Wrong
Why
Remy
Im thinking that actually out the
Right and remember if a complete sentence we say its
Because
Because so can you rephrase that
Yes
What do the denominators do class
Stay the same
All right so lets look at that second question now
Can you read after it says what you notice
Cooper can you read that second question starting with the word how
How would estimation help the person to solve this problem
Okay
Think if they estimated first how would that have helped them solve this problem
Capping our markers because were thinking right now were not drawing
Show me your thumbs up when youve got an answer
Share with your partner please
Colton and Piper have you guys talked already
Okay Red Robin
No
Sebastian
How would estimation help
Estimation would help to see if your estimation is closer to your answer
Okay the question is how to solve this particular problem so Sebastian answered how does estimation help any problem
I want specifics to this problem so lets share with our partner again specific to this problem so in other words estimate
What do you notice when your estimate versus this answer that this student got
Okay five four three two
Bailey
That person can see if they did it wrong
What did they do wrong
Im asking you to estimate
What would the estimate of that one be
Let s think what is one 13 closest to boys and girls zero half or one
Zero
Half
Half
A 13 is closer to half than it is to zero
If you picture that in your head that piece is split into three pieces
Bailey would you like to keep going
Yes
Okay
Closer to a whole would it go over a whole
Would this answer be bigger than one
Yes
Yes because 56 is almost a whole and then you guys just told me that 13 is closer to a half so thats going to push it over and be bigger than one is that answer bigger than one
No
No
No
Estimation can help you catch mistakes like this
Thats why we estimate first
All right what I need you to do right now is your little group of two needs to turn with a group right near them to make a little circle of four
We lost our extra so we will have a group of five because Anna is going to come down and join okay
15 seconds to do that so I need to see a little circle of people multiple little circles
Piper if your partner is Colton you need to go to Colton s circle
Actually you guys why dont we make a big circle
Colton push out a little bit and Luis you come in so we have actually a circle of six
Anna you can join either one of those two circles
Again were operating through kindness so gesture and make her feel welcome to join you
Okay were going to solve this problem correctly right now in whats called a Round Robin so one persons whiteboard is all youre going to use
That should be the person with the shortest hair in the group
Everyone else put your whiteboards down
Your body needs to be right here and make the circle
The amount of time you waste not moving correctly is really ridiculous
Colton if you can scooch a little bit so Piper has space to fit in
Thank you
Okay were going to break this up step by step and youre going to pass the whiteboard for the next step
The first person is going to list the multiples of three
Go
Go
Group
No
No
Only the first person is working so youll zip
If you notice them make a mistake you may correct them or coach them
Rude
Okay
Pass the whiteboard
Okay heres the deal when we did this how many multiples did we typically find
Five
Five yes
Double check did you do that
Didnt I write three equals You dont have to write because thats not a big deal you dont have to do that
Okay pass the whiteboard to your left
The next person does the next step
A a group whats the next step
Now boys and girls some groups are doing a super awesome job of doing this quickly and efficiently some groups are wasting time because theyre trying to be funny
Lucy do we need to keep going
As soon as we hit the same multiple we can stop
Its okay to keep going but thats also wasting time
All right looking at my poster in the back
Pass it to the next person who is going to do step two
Some people worked ahead which is not following instructions
Well youre behind
Oh no youre not you already found it
Other people missed that
Now all youre doing is that one piece and then its the next persons turn
Are you sure thats the lowest common multiple
All right look at step three
Reese can you please read step three
Find the equivalent fraction using the lowest common multiple
Multiple
The next person is only Anna please dont work ahead  is only going to find the equivalent fraction for 13 thats it then youre going to pass it to the next person to find the equivalent fraction for the next number
Go
Go
No I need to see your work I dont want to see just a number
Two people could have gotten it by now
Okay Im confused Remy what are you doing
If I think back to my learning when we found equivalent fractions we wrote the original fraction equals something six and then we multiplied this by something
Thats what I want to see when Im looking for equivalent fractions
But what did I multiply that by
You do both fractions
No thats fine
Thats right but what I need to see Why I wasnt okay with you just writing that even though that was the right answer is I need to see that you understand the thinking so you can repeat it for any fraction not just one
This should be three times what
Pardon
Then this one would be the same
All right final person
Rewrite the original problem and solve
Okay five four three two and one
Especially my group who met with me on Friday I had a strategy to help you remember what were your new fractions and I dont really see anybody using it on their whiteboard
Do you remember what did we do Madison
We had a box
We put a box around our new fractions with our common denominator
Thats for this step so youre not searching through 5000 numbers looking for your new fractions
I know your group has finished when they have stood up and theyre ready to show me the answer
Okay Colton that was a very rude tone that you used
Okay where did 66 come from
I dont know
Okay I see her work here accurate but then when I looked up at my problem whats that second fraction
Whats the denominator of that fraction
Six
Do I need to do anything to it
No
No leave it alone
Write 26 because thats my new fraction plus 56
If the denominator is already our least common multiple we leave it alone
We don t have to do anything
All right show me your answer
I see 76 and I heard one and 16 both are accurate
Please return to your seat
Snack time by the way is long over almost 30 minutes over
You have ten seconds to get back to your seat
Ten nine eight seven six
You can keep it save it for lunch
Dont throw that out
What a waste
I cant even believe you would think about doing that
That doesnt mean throw out perfectly good food
No just dont eat it
Save it for your lunch
Have a dessert at lunch thats all
There are starving people in this world
You shouldn t waste food
All right I appreciate Table 2 I think
Peyton you were the one first
So far its not your lucky day
Your luck is still coming
Okay I appreciate people carefully getting up hopefully not stepping on our markers
Please turn in your journals to page 161
Five four three two one
Before we continue I just want to show you something really quickly and then Ill tell you what our next step is going to be and how were doing this next page
Today were working with mixed numbers
We just had Luis you are not allowed to sharpen your pencil when the Ms Keene is This is because I can only come up with six different warnings they re all different
Our problem was 56 right
Yes
Okay
What if I threw in this
When we have a mixed number and were adding nothing changes except we need to add our whole numbers
Our new was 26 right
Yes
When were rewriting our problem the only difference is instead of just rewriting our fraction we have to rewrite our fraction and our whole number
With your purple partner tell them whats different
First person tell them the difference second person tell them the fraction Im going to write next
Go
Go
Right now even if your purple partner is not here my expectation is your pencil is down and engaging with your All right
Class what do I write
56
Using a whole number changed nothing
You still need to go through all those steps
The only difference is when I write it out I make sure I rewrite that whole number
Now I add whats two plus five
Seven
We originally said this was 76 right
Yes
I wouldve marked that wrong but whats the better answer
Oh goodness
Julia why eight and 16 instead of one and 16
Since the top one is bigger than the bottom you add the seven plus another one
Because hen we turn 76 into one and 16 we have to include that new whole number with our old whole number exactly
Either of these answers would be correct
Any questions
Review whats different when we throw in a whole number
Go
Go
Okay five four three two one
Okay five four three two one
All right
Were going to do this journal page differently than weve done journal pages before
Its called an All Right Robin
What youre going to do is youre going to look at number one and everybodys going to solve it on their whiteboard
When everyones finished at your table youre going to show your whiteboard and talk until you agree on an answer
Once you agree you write it in your journal
With your team review the steps of All Right Robin
Go
Go
Yes you are going to have to go back to your team
They re already gone
Yes I can
Well in the meantime describe that brown one that s right there Anna
Why do I hear talking
Yes but people who are talking now were done
The people who were talking were finished and they were just talking
All right I put the steps in just in case you forget
There should be zero talking until step three
Were going to do this until 1020 okay
If you finish with journal page 160 and 161 during that time I have an additional activity for you to work on but I highly doubt anybody will so if you dont get to the additional activity thats okay
You may begin
Okay good
It sounds like I just pulled the bunch down
No you guys are doing it wrong
Can you please look at the directions
We re on page 161
No I did not if I said that I apologize
It says right here what were supposed to do Use the whiteboard as a tool so too bad
Okay five four three two one
Okay five four three two one
It is very clear to me that you either didn t understand or chose to not follow directions
Pencil is down to listen
Who can share
When should I hear talking
Yes
Which step is that
Yes
Some people were talking straight from the beginning so please follow instructions
I will be asking teams who are not to erase 10 points off of their points okay
Thank you
You guys already showed and talked
Yes
Okay
What number are you guys on
Eight
Just do the whole problem out on the whiteboard and then show it
Do all of number one
Okay ding ding ding I dont know where my bell is
Ding ding
Boys and girls the estimate piece is throwing some people off so I just want to talk about that super quick
Its been doing that I hope that doesnt mean its going to break
Im trying to find our journal page here we go
No still not the right journal page
No
No
Is this the right one
Yes
Youre sure
Yes
Okay
For the estimate thats throwing people off we spent a lot of time on estimating today so obviously its important
Look and think thats close to three and a half plus thats also close to four and a half
Which equals eight
Theres my estimate took me 30 seconds
Your estimate should not take you more than 30 seconds
If its really sticking you just skip here
I dont want the table to be waiting for someone who is staring t the estimate for 10 minutes
Each of these problems should take everybody two minutes or less
Also if you notice a team member super stuck and youre finished what could you do as a kind classmate
Todd
You can help him
You can help him
Yes you have to do the estimate that took me 30 seconds and then you have to show your work for the problem and then you show it to your group
Any questions
Make sense
No
Keep working
You guys keep going as long as you go
You guys have showed it
Where are you stuck
My only disagreement with Joey is how did this become this
I dont see nowhere
If youre going to turn it into a mixed number thats awesome but then I want to see first your improper fraction then your mixed number
Do you have your whiteboard
Because thats what were working with right now were working on our whiteboards
Okay
If everybodys done time to show
You guys are the rockstar group
Instead of going through this are you done  not the smartest you just work and get done
Which one are we on now
You need to be writing something on your whiteboard because thats our step right here
Write all the work and answer on the whiteboard
Im noticing that all three of you agree and he actually agrees too because isnt this the same thing
But it looks like maybe youve got someone whos stuck so what we should see as a group is maybe helping her out
Im not sure youre on the right number
I think thats why shes stuck
Were on this one
Thats your problem
I observed what she was writing down and I was like Where is that coming from
She was on the wrong number so that the quick fix
Well because she doesnt feel she needs help because she was working on a different number
She was working on this one correctly
Shes right she doesnt need help and you were right to ask
Thank you for being kind
Lets just move on to number two then okay
