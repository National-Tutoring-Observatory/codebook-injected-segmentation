All right guys
Were going to be in our textbook page 136

Page 136 in the textbook
Notice this is going back to 34
34 is what we focused on on Monday
Whats that all about
Factoring
Factoring
You need some good practice in factoring
Were going to start with the factors theorem
Douglin
You dont even have your book
Youre not paying attention to me so give me this
You wont turn it off
Give it to me
All right
All right
Page 136 the factor theorem
Our factor theorem is showing us that if we had a polynomial and its got a factor then basically this is saying that when I plug in the K value I get an interim zero
That means I dont have a remainder
If I dont have a remainder then that is a factor
If I do have a remainder then that isnt a factor
Im going to show you an example here in just a second
If we look at dividing 125 by 25 how many times does it go in
Five
Five
Five
Whats the remainder
Zero
It goes in evenly
25 is a factor
Whereas if I take 125 and I divide it by 20 how many times does it go in there
625
Okay so now we would normally then write this as our answer is six plus five over whatever were dividing by
Of course we can reduce that
The idea here this is just a fancy way of talking about polynomials
If were going to talk about polynomials if we dont have a zero remainder that is not a factor
Number five determine whether a linear binomial is a factor
Theyre asking us the question is that a factor of this
One of the ways of doing this is to plug in the K value
Remember this is an X K format so my K value is
Two
Two
I plug into two and I come up with a four
Is it a factor
No
No its not a factor because we end up with a remainder
For this second one whats the K value then
5 and I do synthetic division with it
Now if I do this synthetic division Im looking over here so my remainder is
Zero
Is X5 a factor
Why do we synthetic division
Is it just another way to do it
We couldve plugged in 5
Youre a good straight man
If I did synthetic division I can answer the question but I cant go any further
If I answer the question and its zero then I can use this to write that next factor
I cant do that if Im just plugging it in
For example if thats my answer and since I have zero there I know that thats one of the factors so I can rewrite my polynomial with that factor
Then I also know that 3X whats going to be the exponent that goes with that three
It goes down one
Im going to skip the X2 so now I have X5
I can answer the question just plugging it in but I cant get to the factoring part
The synthetic division helps me do the factoring and then I need to ask myself Well can I factor this
and then use the different factoring skills that I have to see if we can do that
The better way of doing it is with synthetic division
Example six theyre basically telling us in example six that X3 is a factor and they want us to factor it completely
Its not just asking if its a factor its saying it is and use that information to do the factoring
We go through this synthetic division process
We confirm because of our zero remainder that X3 is a factor
Then if I drop down one Ive got X to the third
I dont have a square
I dont have a linear term
Ive got a constant though and I write that in
Then the question is am I done factoring or can I factor further
I can factor further using the difference of two cubes
This was also introduced in this lesson 34
If I recognize that I have two cubes I can then factor it as the AB
In this case it would be X1 and then the quadratic that goes with it
Then I ask myself Well can I factor that quadratic
Are there factors of 1 that add up to 1
No so I cant factor that any further and Im done
We practice synthetic division quite a bit
Hopefully you feel a little bit more confident with that
Were going to practice that quite a bit now
What Id like you to do then is go to the journal page 79
Journal page 79
All right
All right
Page 79 lets work number 15 together
The first thing we need to do is set up our synthetic division process
If we know that X1 is a factor remember XK is the format so X helps me understand that 1 is my K value
Then Im looking at the coefficient of my cubed term
I dont have a quadratic term
There isnt an X2 in this I have the zero
I bring down the 13 and the 12 and so I need to start my process
Thats the setup
Any questions about the setup
Yes Zach
How do you feel like X
Well the format of this whole process this whole idea is that its XK and that what I put over here has to be the K value
So instead of just looking at this and thinking about 1 is the K value Im reminding you that the format of this is an X
So if I write it as X it shows me that my K value is actually 1
Ive got to flip the sign basically when I go to put it over here
All right
All right
Other questions on the setup here
All right
All right
Step number one person number one at the table remind your team whats step number one here
You bring down the 1
All right eyes upfront
Very simply that first step is just to bring down that 1 then well multiply to get the 1 and we add them together
Then were just going to keep repeating that process
1  1 add those together multiply those two together add those together
What does that zero tell me
It is a factor
I can rewrite this the polynomial with X1 and then I have to convert this back into a polynomial
So its going to be 1 is the coefficient of X because were going to drop down one
This is my linear term
That was my coefficient of the quadratic coefficient of the linear and my constant
Then ask the question What are the factors of 12 that add up to 1
3 or 4
4 because we want it to add to 1
These are all linear binomials because X1
If I was to graph this itd make a line
That would make a line that would make a line
Thats as far as I can go in my factoring
This question is not asking you this next part but I want you to see that when we moved from 34 which was this section to 35 when we were talking about solving weve got to go through all of these and then we have to figure out using the zero product property I just solve through all of those so in each case Id have to say X10 so X is 1 4 3
If I have to solve using this method that would be the step that we add onto it
All right
All right
Use that as your model practice 16 and 17
Notice that when youre done with 16 and 17 youre just going to go back to 1
For the rest of this period youre going to practice factoring
All right
All right
Lets get going
That is applying this right here
What I have to do is factor Q and come back to Q
Actually were here
I have to recognize that this has
Weve rewritten it as Q so that I know what my A and my B values are
So then I can just simply use this pattern
Im going to do AB
For the 6X
Then Im going to square the A value multiply the A and B together times 5 and then Im going to square then new X factor
6218 thats plus two right
Does that make sense now
Its tying in
Wait
Can you guys come quick
No
Did you keep it
You just keep it
You split the middle
With long division we subtract with synthetic division we add
Yes thats how I do it
Notice how I have a 3 and a 1 but I dont have an x2
because weve got to cover it down one step at a time
Make sure you do this
The first thing I would do in factoring that is ask that question is there a common factor that I can pull up
Now I could take out a
I could take out the twos and then youre left with three here and a three here
not one we have to multiply A  B  add up the B and then
This is my map to how to factor quadratic stuff
The shortcut is to find the factors of 12 so you do 66 is 36
I can just list all them out that add up to 1
What was the factors of 36 that add up to that 18 and 2
Notice how those two they do multiply to 12 and then they add to 1
Did that help
Can you hear me now
Share
You need to come and explain to her how I got the mean here
Wait how does 18X turn to X3
I do multiply 8  C and thats 9  So 10X is going to be X9X
I multiplied 8  C
Just 8 not the 96
The x2 is not part of the equation
So I get 9
Are there factors of 9 that add upto 10
How about 1 and 9
So I do like 1x and add 9x and they add upto 10
So I have to change my equation
You factor that out and what do I end up with
Make sure you havent lost your 2 or your x2
It doesnt matter what order they are in when you multiply because we use the same characters
Great
How do you factor
Notice what is the A value for that  You multiply 33
Then simplify the what factors of that and the 10
What that means is we split the linear term and now instead of writing plus 10x  plus 9x
We cant lose three table factors because you notice what X X mean
You do I with whats called
In other words 3x2x9x
Add the x2 out there
I am going to do one thing here if you let me
because then I can pull that out and that out
There you go
The answers are on the board at least we can check out
Heres where it going to be helpful to do an intermediate  with what is it thats actually cubed plus what is it thats actually  Now I know what the A and the B are in that little part of the formula
So we have five minutes
For this one are there factors of 2 that add up to 1
And that would be
1 and 2
There you go
That tells you are going to be
This it had 3x210x3
We are just going to deal with that and what was the other quadratic that we had x2 x2  So two different strategies
Let me combine them into one and youll see that they are the same
If I multiply those two together what do I get
I get 2
What are the factors of 2 that add uptp 1
We do the same thing here by multiplying those two and what are the factors that add up to 10
If my A value is 1 my factors are x1 and x2
If A is not 1 and I do that x1 then x9 notice because that times that equals that guy
No
Thats where the strategy is different then I am using this to split that
Over here this became my factor over here Instead of 10x  These are the same its just our strategy for factoring
This is called factor by grouping
I am going to group  so what do they have in common
What do I pull out of this
Thats what I am looking for for those two to be the same
Now factor this so that I dont have any addition in the middle
I am not multiplying that by that
I am actually taking that and adding that
Now I got the
If I had 2x  and I factor that I dont factor out the 2 twice
Well this is 2X  25
Ladies and gentlemen hopefully youve got some good factoring practice
How many people got one two three four done
I have got a few that got three
Four
Four
What
I said multiple times
When youre done with 15 16 and 17 go back to one and start working on factoring
When the bell rings were switching gears but heres the answers to that extra practice youve been looking at
Ladies and gentlemen Im going to encourage you to take a photo of the answers and take your journals home or take those pages out and do these practices
These are the kind of strategies that you need to know how to do
You got to be able to factor
Get those answers and then come back to these pages and spend some time practicing that
Were going to bounce back into the textbook now
Page 147 in your textbooks
Page 147
If youre person number two raise your hand
Who is number two
Walk your team through answering this four example three polynomial
On the count of three give me the degree
One two three
Three
The leading coefficient
One
I heard a variety of answers
Whats the end behavior look like
The constant
We need that information for this rational root theorem
Whats the root word here
Ratio
How do we write ratios
Theres a clue
When were talking about rational root theorem were talking about fractions
Were going to be prereading fractions
The formality is This is the way of expressing any polynomial
Its got some coefficient ese bene and X is raised to some number all the way down to intercept zero which is our constant
It has integer coefficients so we dont have any fractions in the polynomial no fractions in the polynomial
Every rational solution alphabet equals zero
We get that zero
We dont have a remainder
Its going to be a factor
We start
In our numerator position theres factors of a constant
Numerator factors of a constant
Its 120
Is two a factor
Yes
How about three
No
Four
Four
Yes
Five
Five
Yes
Six
No
Seven
No
Eight
No
Nine
No
10
Yes
20
Yes
Those are the factors of my constant
coefficient
What are the factors of one
Thankfully thats a little bit easier
with the two in the denominator
We can also have positive and negative values of each of these
How many different factors do we have
12 factors
You have an issue
Not of 20
Were thinking of what multiplies to 20
This makes a great multiplechoice question or part A maybe on another three questions
Weve already figured out all the possibilities here
Now were going to figure out what do we do with that information
Im going to test my first one a positive one
Then Im going to test my next one a 1
If none of them have a zero remainder then Im going to keep going until I find something that has a zero remainder
Guys
We find out that 1 is not a factor but 1 is
What does that mean in terms of the factor itself
Remember its the K Im sorry XK
Its X
Because Ive done synthetic division I now know the next factor and I can apply my math to factoring skills to that quadratic
Come up with those factors
Theyre all linear binomial I am done factoring
The solutions the zero product property
Im setting X1 0 and solving for X X4 0 X50
I come up with my final solution set
try numbers or is it specific numbers you try
Notice over here when we set this up if I was to write this I have 1 1 2 2
I test until I find one that works
Once I find one that works I now know that Ive got a factor
This tells me the next factor that goes with it
Theoretically
Probably not 12 because how many numbers would have worked
Three
Three of them wouldve worked in this case
It wouldve worked for 1 for 4 and for 5
You could have had to do Nine before you found one
This is the rational root theorem
We didnt get to that yesterday
We had a delayed start so we didnt quite have enough time to get to this part of it
Were going to practice this with the extra practice in the journal
Were going to start here on problem one and we want to try and work through as much of these
Page 83
Were back to the journal
Whats your answer whats your solution
Right now this one doesnt have 0
So how are we going to
I never signed the form you can use this audio
Whats true about 2 8 and 6
They are all even numbers
What can I pull out
Standard 10
What about the Xs
Are there Xs in all of them
So how many Xs are you going to pull out
One
So you are going to factor out 20X first
Whatever you put to  has to multiply to that
Now Ive got a simple quadratic
Are there factors of 3
Do you have a question
Ill be with you next
Lets see
Whats the one thing you got to do now
How do we solve for R Yes you said that equal to 0 that equal to 0 and that equal to 0 and you have your three answers
Otherwise thats 3
Then here you pull that up
Then the first thing you have to do is  You got the right idea about what you are factoring out but you are going to do it with everything on the one side of the equation
If I am multiplying three things and it has to equal 0  because I cant do 3410 Its got to be 0
What would make that equal to 0
Once you have it all factored you go R1 you 6R10  you solve them all for the R then you have your answer
4 out of 80 is 20  Those are pretty close could just doublecheck our work
Does that times that equal that
grouping those two then we group the other two
Now we are in lock
So what do we have left after you pulled that out
Whats true about 25 and
When I factor the difference of two squares I get two factors
Whats the other one
Notice the difference of two squares can be factors of with a plus and a minus version
In other words if I start with this I have a plus or minus version of that factor
I am going to have those two factors
Alright ladies and gentlemen Im going to suggest the same thing on this practice set is that you get a picture of the answers and then continue to work on these
Youve got to be able to factor 34 youve got to be able to solve 35
