G is E
Yes so then it goes G So it should be DCEA
Almost like what we talked about in the first place
10 seconds are left
Whats the frigging Oh my God
Are you serious
Yes it was
Okay so Im just going to say
So its DCBADFE
ATFE Mr
Genius you should know this
What do you have
So you just keep the same base
You dont double the base
Dont forget that for this part you should be able to use your toolkit
Did you just  my seat down  leaning on it
Yes so you dont end up on my feet
Do you know how to do it
Yes I do
How do you do it
That part you just get
That works
But theyre just
That works too
Yes you dont have to solve it
Im still doing it because Im still
Its not a bad plan
You just subtract these
Oh wait
You guys multiplied the fraction
Oh because you subtract this
Yes you subtract this
Five to the power of eight
Its 731
You multiply the powers together and then you do five to the power of  731
No wait
You can actually solve for that
You could
So its actually 427
125 to the power of 23
Thats awesome
Good
Thank you sir
Ill get that graded for you and get it back tomorrow
All right youve got to get control of this group
Yes you were supposed to be the genius
Come on
So its eight to the power of two
Its eight to the power of two 64
Thats probably wrong
All right everybody is just about done with one and two
Those answers are on the board for you to check your work
So how can I use maybe this portion
I got mostly the right answers
Anything to the zero power is what
Zero
No
Oh one
One
is the answer to that one
Okay so how do we do exploration 3A
Did you really
Yes Im a genius
If were starting right now with what was it 98 or 96
98   and two to the half
How can I rewrite it using this property
The brilliance at this table is impeccable
1024 is it a multiple of four
So think about that would be four times of what
Okay so what would this simplify to if I have a four  and Im taking the what root of that
All right have you checked your answers to one and two
Have you checked your answers
And some of you are done with three
so there is the answers to three
All right
Ladies and gentlemen one more minute and then were going to jump into the textbook for a few minutes and then well take a break
Yes I think we will
That was the longest five minutes
All right
Ladies and gentlemen were going to be on the textbook
Lets see this is page What page
There we go
Were on page 200
Textbook page 200
Ladies and gentlemen
Eight and nines up here please
He knew what I was saying
All right so example number one are some of the properties youve already applied
You noticed how if were on the same level we can add exponents and it simplifies our process
Same thing happening here if you are on the level we add those exponents
If theyre on Actually in this case since its this times itself they raised each of those to the power of two multiplied those together
So power to power we multiply
On the same level were adding
Power to power we multiplied out here simplified our answer process
Here we have something thats raised to a negative 15
Notice how that negative was carried all the way through and the simplification was done at the end
Now thats not There are alternative ways of solving these as well as you guys were figuring out
I mean you could work on whats the fourth root of seven times the square root of seven but thats going to be a little bit more complex
So youre going to use these properties to help simplify things down to their simplest form
I think you worked problems like this
Does anybody have any questions on this particular style of applying those
Natalia you would be a great candidate
Do these make sense to you now
Yes
Okay
All right cool
Well do one more example and then well take a break
In our toolkits open your toolkit so that youve got this in front of you
That was part of what we gave you in the toolkit
If we look at this first example notice if our index is the same and were multiplying so this is important that its multiplication we can simplify this and put everything under one radical and simplify that
Then in our second example notice again when our index is the same And were dividing now
Up here our index was the same when we were multiplying here our index is the same and were dividing we can combine under one radical
Thats the property thats being worked right here
Any questions on those two
I think you used those two in some of those practice problems as well
Okay lets go ahead and well take a break
When we come back well look at example three
There was a desire to break to the commons
Yes
All right so you got 10 minutes to be at the double doors
Set your timer
10 minutes be at the double doors
Im getting apple juice
Thank you Andy
I need to put a sign out
Ill be back
Okay were good
Thank you
How are you doing today
good
Good
And you
Im doing fine
What did you do over the weekend
Its nice to do nothing
Who lives in your home
Your mom dad
Brothers sisters
A sister
Good
If youre in Greenfield you live in the City of Greenfield
Your house
yes
Yes
How did you come here
All right were going to be on page 201
Journal or
Textbook
Textbook 201
All right page 201
All right lets get those phones put away gentlemen
Yes maam
Oh in here
What page
Were on 201
All right so I want to walk you through several examples here
In this first one the recommendation is to factor out any perfect cube
Now we havent worked with perfect cubes very much so we kind of have to start thinking about that
What would 23 be
Eight
Eight
33
43
No 64
Its 64
Hold up let me check this
Four times four you have
Times four
Perfect cube
Did we get  48
I think so but I dont know
Yes there is a format for your calculator to do   yes
So you can
All right lets continue on
Whats 53
125 all right
That was a little bit easier
Whats the square root
All right so in your toolkit so your second toolkit lets just go ahead and write what these are
23 33 43 53 and 63
Lets
In your toolkit were going to add these perfect cubes
All right the math checks out
Yes thats what Ive been saying
Only intelligent
Well do it this way so that it catches the front of the room
All right
Eyes up front please
Now if you dont recognize that 27 is a factor of 135 who would
I mean were probably not expected to do that
When we look at 135 what do we know is a factor
Five
Five because it ends in five so I can start my factoring just by dividing that by five
5goes into 13 two times with three left over
5 goes into 35 seven times
If were recognizing that 27 is a perfect cube we could stop there or I could think about what the factors of 27 3x9 and 5x3x3x3
If it helps you to factor down this way so that since Im looking for a cube root and I see that Ive got those three 3s thats where you see the one 3 being pulled out in front with 5 being left behind
Any questions on that
Then if we look at this next one whats happening here
When do they go from this to this whats happening
Magic
Yes it does kind of look like magic
Hold on let me get this
Were going to put that in the toolkit today
Now let me ask you this what does this equal
Look very carefully up here this is important
This equals one
Now if I multiply by one am I changing my number
Not necessarily  its getting more specific in terms of
If I take seven and multiply it times one its still seven right
Yes
If I multiply 7x2x2 my  step can multiply across
I have 142
Is it still seven
Yes
Yes so why are we finding some sort of one to multiply our problem by
To remove the radical from the denominators
Exactly
In simplifying things you cannot have an answer that has a radical in the denominator so you got to get rid of that
Notice what Im multiplying by here
If we focus on what was chosen to multiply this by 8 is 2x2x2 right
Yes
What kind of root are we taking here
A fifth
A fifth root so I need two more 2s
Basically in order to take a fifth root right I have to have five 2s in order to take a fifth root
Thats why were multiplying by the fifth root of four
Ive got one two three 2s there two 2s right there
That gives me the five 2s I need because watch what happens right here
Lets track just what happens in the denominator
Notice that I end up simplifying to a single number and theres no radical in the denominator
I like it
One more time to give out this one
Im starting
Lets see I want to enlarge this a little bit
Looking at this guy so this is our prompt
Were starting with something that 7  8 isnt going to simplify
If this had been 32 for example up here then we want to do 32  8 all to the one fifth power type thing or the fifth root of 328 because we can simplify that
In this particular case were basically stuck not being able to simplify the 7 and the 8 at all and so were doing something called rationalizing the denominator
I have to come up with something to multiply it by so that I get a whole number answer
Thats whats happening here
We have to figure out well whats our fancy form of one that were going to multiply by
This example is also what I have for you to put into your toolkit
Id like you to read through the information thats here on this page
In other words this little piece of paper it is another toolkit thing so youre going to just slap this into the second toolkit
Its something else to add to that toolkit
Lets go
All right ladies and gentlemen
The narrative on the right side of that paper is an important definition of what it means to put an expression in simplest form
No radicands have perfect nth powers as factors
In other words I shouldnt have eight as a cube root of eight shouldnt be part of my final answer because the cube root of eight equals two
Now the cube root of four
The cube root of four
Yes so we leave it as t 4
If youre leaving your answer with  24 where 8 is a factor of 24 you havent put it in simple form so thats what this first bullet is talking about
The second no radicands contain fractions
Remember the radicand is the number inside underneath the radical so no fractions inside there
Then the third one no radicals in the denominator
Thats what we were just dealing with
This is an example where if I have a radical in the denominator how do I go about simplifying that
It turns out for this particular problem thats the only thing were doing is rationalizing the denominator
Thats what its called rationalizing the denominator
The tricky part about rationalizing the denominator is just figuring out what form of the number one were going to multiply something by
Once we figure out what it is that goes in the denominator we just write the exact same thing in the numerator
Its our formal one that we multiply by
Questions on that
Probably just need to be practicing it
Back into the textbook were going to look at few more examples
Were on example four page two of two I believe
Example number four
Heres our prompt now weve got some fancy thing here in the denominator its got a radical but were adding
Not as simple to figure out what form of one that we want to use
You see its just rewritten right here
What did they end up choosing is going to be the form that we have there
Oh this is  says Its conjugate
It is conjugates but if I have two things Im multiplying two binomials that Im multiplying one as a plus and one as a minus
Difference of two squares
The difference of two squares
Because what happens when we take the square root of three times the square root of three
Three
It will be three
Important to recognize so the square root of x well just make it a generic same thing as the square root of x2
If my index and my power are the same what happens to it
They just undo each other
Thats where I can then have five squared is  3 x  3 is 3 so 253 gives me 22
I now have a number in my denominator so get rid of the radical symbol
Heres another way that were going to be responsible for rationalizing the denominator
We cant leave this with that radical and the denominator weve got to change it up
Were going to use the difference of two squares as the idea and as Santiago was saying we talk about it being a conjugate
Conjugation
Notice that the only difference here is just that the sign changes
Questions on that one
Youre getting the idea if we end up with a radical in the denominator I got to do something
These are the examples that well be referring back to
Lets look at example five so adding and subtracting
Notice in this case that my index is the same and my radicand is the same so what did they do here
Three
Where did that one come from
Its an implied  factoring out a common
I think
This is similar to x7x because the 4th root of 10 is just like saying x I have one of them then seven of them so that means Ive got eight of them
If I look over here notice that now instead of being in radical form Im in exponent form but theyre both the same I have two xs and 10xs so I have 12xs so 12x8 to the Then over here theyre not the same
Whats going to happen
Whats a factor of 54
Two
Two two times what
Twentyseven so its two Oh thats a
Perfect cube
Thats a perfect cube
My 3rd root of all of that we know the3rd root of 27 is 3 and then I have a square root of two
Even though I didnt see it right away here I actually have that so we cant forget the three thats in there
We actually have a cube root of two thats represented in both
Ive simplified that and I have one cube root of two here so 31 and Ive got two
We can treat exponents and radicals just like weve used x before
Questions on that one
Lets keep going
Now you know this is all going to where we have more than one thing that we have to do
As we start to look at this guy I now have to think about what does it mean to take  64 what does it mean to take  y to the 6
Notice the first step was since my index is three Im trying to use an exponent with the same index
In other words I want to look to see can I write these as a cube
It might take you a little practice to get used to recognizing that 64 is 43 even though we stumbled over that a little bit ago
You might remember that
Now that Ive written things as cubes I can split them up if it helps to think of them that way and we know that if I have a cube root of something thats cubed
It cancels out
They cancel each other
Two cubes cancel each other out then Im left with y2
Thats combining a couple of the properties that we just got through talking about
Now were going to talk about a quotient were dividing something remembering that little piece of paper that I just gave you that it said you cant have a fraction under a radical
We cant leave it as the fourth root of a fraction
Notice our first step was to split it up
This one is already written as the index and the power are the same
This one is not so weve rewritten y to the eight as something to the power of four so that those two undo each other and Im left with that
Then the question is why did they put an absolute value thing in there
Its not based on the principal root
Whats a number that I can take the fourth root of
They can be negative and positive
Yes if I say I take the fourth root of whats 2x2x2x2
Then you can have minus two and thats
Plus or minus
its going to be oops two I was starting to write a four
Explain what youre talking about Santiago
For example when you see a square and really any root actually the answer you want to typically get that is implied is the principal root but for the even index you can get a positive or a negative answer based on what you get
Yes am I not explaining enough
For example if it was  16 the answer could be the 4 or 4 because either one is squared is 16
When we are typically working with radicals we want to get the principal root which is the positive answer and the absolute bar value is there to strictly involve with principal root
Yes that goes back to when we first learned square roots
When you first learned square root youd say the square root of  9 is 3
You wouldnt have said plus or minus three but when we started with getting into parabolas and we know that most parabolas when we graph them have two xintercepts
Like we see here with two xintercepts
That s where we need to take into account that plus and minus
Any other questions
Any questions on that one
That introduces a little interesting aspect to it
Example number seven
Oh my God
What
Wait until you see the Level 4
Not yet
In these particular problems were obviously starting to have multiple steps pulling multiple things together and learning how to pull in all of those different properties
Thats whats going to happen both when I am multiplying and dividing and adding and subtracting
Things are going to start to look a lot more complex
Now remember none of these things that weve talked about are very difficult
Its just when we have two or three or four or six of them that we have to apply and trying to figure out Well what order do I do that in
Whats going to make it the simplest thing
Thats just going to take practice as you start to recognize patterns
When we get out here pretty soon right 48
Yes
Yes so we dont really have time today to do much practice on this so be referring to the textbook and your toolkit as you work on tonights homework
Tonights homework will be due then by midnight tomorrow
Its not in there yet
If you want go ahead and turn the microphones off
