It really jumps into what were doing today
Tell me what was your big understanding from math yesterday
Lets start with James
Yesterday was understanding how to subtract and add different common denominators and fractions
Thank you for starting this would you call on someone else
Were trying to find common denominators
Im hearing like I say her big understanding from yesterday was trying to find common denominators
Im going to challenge you Louis to share more about why
Why do we need common denominators sometimes
When we have common denominators then we can add and subtract fractions
Thats what Im hearing you guys say
Yes
Quinn would you like to add
Were trying to get common denominators to solve unlike denominators because its kind of hard to solve with unlike denominators
What do you mean its kind of hard to solve unlike denominators tell us more
Because if you have 1238 you really dont know how to add 1338 because there are two unlike denominators
We need to speak about that
Anything you want to add
Today were going to learn three more or three different strategies that were going to add to our toolbox today so that we have a lot of strategies everybody some of your pockets some of you dont put in your back pocket would be this is an expression
Im going to keep something in my back pocket even if you dont have a back pocket
Were going to have many strategies to find common denominators to help us add and subtract fractions
All right thanks for your ideas
Im going to have you head back to your seats please and get whiteboard marker math journal
I love how quickly most of you have whiteboard and marker out already
Did you scribble on
Now were starting
There we go
Okay
All right friends
Id like you to look at the front whiteboard and I would like to hear all of our voices for what were going to accomplish in lesson 52 today
I want to hear all of your voices
Ready
Go
Go
Im going to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions
Okay
In your own words what is that asking
What are we going to do today
A minute ago we talked to our face partners
Youre talking to your face partner again and this time partner B is speaking first
Look at your manage map
Raise your hand if youre partner B and what is our learning intention asking us to do today
Use fractions and multiples to add and subtract fractions to find common denominators
Please bring your conversations to a close three two one zero
Youll find that thats how I get our attention a lot I say three two one and get to zero voices
Emma will you tell us that what was the conversation you and your partner have
We said it will be to use factors and multiples to find common denominators for numbers that have uncommon denominators so you could add and subtract the fractions
Love it
I heard Emma say we are having two new strategies today using factors and multiples
Actually I think theres three new strategies today that we use factors and multiples to help us find common denominators so that we can add and subtract fractions
I want to hear all of your voices again how will we know if we have it today
I will be successful when I can find a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work
At the end of math today you will know how to use different strategies and I will be asking you to explain how the different strategies work
Okay
Yes my dear
Yes my dear
Okay
All right
On your whiteboard just a couple of things I want to show you
T2 would you normally have them put this in their spiral
We give them a copy of it
They have copies
You have it for them
Okay
I want you to think about those words factors and multiples
These are our math vocab words that youve probably heard in third and fourth grade but it is important we clarify them in fifth grade so that we know exactly what were finding today in math
If you look at the factor pair you see the box on the screen
Factors are numbers we multiply together to get the target number
Everybody write 36 on your whiteboard
Now I want you to start thinking just like they did here what are the different ways you can multiply two factors to get 36
Lets start listing them
We can do 1
36
There you go write those two down
We can do 2 what
18
3
12
4
9
9 and
6 6
6 6
Those are all factors of 36
Miss I have a question
Absolutely
Im looking at how students wrote them and they wrote them in a variety of different ways is there a specific way that they should write that or can they just write 1 3636 2 1836
Can I hold this up
I think that in math its important that kids do it the way that makes sense to them
One time I heard this called the rainbow strategy
You can make make a rainbow 1 and 36 1 36
This student in your class listed the factor pairs with a comma in between
This student in your class listed them this way
Im going to tell you theres not one way but it is important that you have a strategy that works for you to list all the factors of a number
Lily would you hold yours up too
This is Lilys
Okay
I dont remember which one is which which one is yours Nicki
All right friends
These are what we call factors
The numbers you multiply are what
Factors
Factors
When you multiply the number the answer is called
Its actually called a product but we would say 20 is a multiple of 4 because 4 5 is
20
20
We would say 20 is a multiple of 5 because 5x4 is 20
I want you to get in the habit of using the words factor and multiple in your math conversations
All right
You may erase your whiteboard
Were going to get started with todays lesson
Some of our lesson today will be at our desks
Some of it youll be working with partners
Some of it were going to be doing something called Mix and Mingle
Mix and Mingle is a strategy for us to talk about our thinking with a partner thats not of our table group
Gets us moving gets us to start thinking gets us talking with someone that we havent been talking to
I may give you a fun question to practice Mix and Mingle with before we do it for math
Get your whiteboard ready
Heres your question
What is your favorite part of being in T2s class
You have 30 seconds
What is your favorite part of being in T2s class
When youre ready please stand up
Fletcher Im going to have you do an example with me where Im going to say mingle that means were just going to wander around and when teacher says freeze we high five
The person with the lightercolored shirt will share first
I would say my favorite part of being in T2s class is her morning meetings and her kindness messages
You would respond to me like Yes I like that too or something like that and then I would hear from you
Will you tell me yours
I like to be in her class because she always helps you with what youre doing unless she knows that you can do the problem and that youre just asking for help so that you know that youre getting it right and stuff
Im hearing you say shes really good at giving you just the right push and knowing how hard to have you work and then helping you when you need it
Yes
Awesome
Thanks for being my partner
We would mingle again and I would find the next person that have their hand up ready
Youre not going to wait for me to tell you to find your next partner
Youre going to put your hand up and find your next partner to talk with
The other thing thats important in Mix and Mingle is that you keep your conversations focused on what is on your whiteboard and youre always polite and respectful
If you are looking for a partner walk toward the carpet and then someone around here might be like Hey I need a partner too
Come join me
Please Mix and Mingle
When I say freeze youll talk and the person that speaks first has the lighter shirt
Go
Go
All right
Freeze please
High five the person closest to you
If you dont have a partner right away walk toward the carpet and find someone else thats walking toward the carpet
Excellent
Then if you have something like this where theres one person that doesnt have a partner either you can find a teacher or you can join another team so that we have someone whos always sharing
Hey lightercolored shirt go
Remember as soon as youre done you say thank you so much and look for that next partner
Remember if youre looking for a partner walk toward that carpet and look for someone else that needs a partner
Three two one zero voices
Please thank the person youre with right now and head back to your seat
At your seat right now you are going to share something you heard from someone else in the classroom
T2are your teams numbered like team one team two
I have one two three four five
All right
Then my friends that are my outliers they know what table to go to
Excellent
What were going to do is Im just going to call on someone but its going to be based on your table number and your seat number
You need to know right now
Think to yourself Okay Im table four person two or Im table one person four or five
All right
Please stand up if you are a three at your table group
Stay standing if you sit at team four
Everyone else sits and let team four Whos team four
Excellent
Would you tell me your name
Carson
Carson would you share with your classmates whats something youve heard from someone else in your Mix and Mingle
From Jon he said that his favorite part of being in T2s class is T2
Love it
Thanks for sharing
All right
Stand up if you are Actually lets do three claps for Carson for sharing something she got
All right
Please stand up if you are teammate number four
Stay standing if youre at team one
All right
Fletcher tell us
What did you hear from a classmate
Tell them not me
Ive already been in fifth grade
I heard from Olivia that she always helps him be able to learn and how she always knows what to do to get him to understand math stuff
Thanks for sharing Fletcher
Give him three claps please
We will do one more
Stand up if you are teammate number one
I would like to hear from table five
Stay standing if youre at table five
I heard from Ava that she likes being in T2s class because  science
Science love it
Three claps
All right
Please erase your board
Were going to do Mix and Mingle with a math question now
If I can find the mouse this is what I do
Movement
Here we go my friends
All right
Do you use this
I always use the resources but
Then if you have something like this where theres one person that doesnt have a partner either you can find a teacher or you can join another team so that we have someone whos always sharing
Then theres activities
I love this
Okay my friends weve already talked about this
Remember you may use a strategy that works for you
What are the factors of 36
Go on your whiteboard
Im seeing some several different ways and I love how Im seeing several different ways that kids are writing down their math
All right
Okay
When I say three two one show youre going to show your whiteboard and I want you to look around the room at how many different ways kids are writing down factors and factor pairs for 36
Three two one show
Look around the room and look at the different methods different classmates used for writing the factors and factor pairs of 36
Okay quietly put your boards down and check yourself
Do you have 1 and 36
Yes
2 and 18
No
3 and 12
Yes
No wait that was only
We just have 2 and 18
4 and 9
Yes
And 6
Yes
Because of 6 6
Those are factor pairs
All right
Multiple
This is a different type of question and we are going to do Mix and Mingle with this question
What are the first six multiples of 8
When you multiply 8 what are the first six multiples you get
I want you to remember that a multiple is different than a factor
A multiple is the answer when you multiply the factor
Ill give you a hint
Whats 8 1
8
Theres your first multiple of 8
Whats 8 2
16
Theres your second multiple of 8
All right were going to do a little Mix and MingleOkay
Please stand up
Its okay if youre not quite done but you will have a conversation with your mingle partner
Ready
Mix
Please freeze
High five the person closest to you and would you please share darker shirt first
What are the first six multiples of 8 and do you have the same thinking
Go
Go
Tell me what you have Junior
Are we looking for someone
There we go
All right
I love how youre finding that next partner
Go check your answers with one more different person please
All right and please wrap up your conversation thank your partner and head to your seats
Three two one zero voices we should all be back in our seats and you may check your thinking on the front whiteboard
Yes
Great idea
Okay
Why is it impossible first of all to list all the multiples of a number
James Oh my gosh I love how fast your brain thought of that
Say that nice and loud
It can go on forever
What can go on forever
The multiples of 8 or 1
Multiples of 8
If were talking about what are the first six multiples of 8
We just asked you to write down six
They could go on and on and on forever because numbers are infinite
They can go on and on forever
Why do our multiples of 8 start at 8
Think about that for a minute
Why do our multiples of 8 start at 8
Anyone willing to share their thinking about that
Quinn
Because 0 8 is always 0 and 1 8 is always whenever a number multiply one
I like that
Emma
Like she said theres no other number to multiply by
Youre going to get smaller than 8
Is 1 a multiple of 8
No
Say that again
1 isnt a multiple of 8 its a factor
Jon is saying 1 is a factor of 8 1 is not a multiple of 8
I love T2s math sentence starters up there on the wall
Jon say that one more time and I want someone to add on with one of those sentence starters up there
Can 1 be a multiple of 8
Speak up can you hear him
Hey speak up a little louder
No
1 cant be a multiple of 8 because its a factor
1 is a factor of 8 1 is not a multiple who can respond to that
Would you call on someone Jon
I want to add to that and I agree with you because 1 is a factor
Its not a multiple because a multiple is what she said its a number  8
2 816 but 1 88 so it is a factor
Okay
Lets do one more practice on our whiteboard please
Ready
Yes
Write the number 12
The first thing I want you to solve for are the factors of 12
What are the factors or the factor pairs for 12
When you say factor or factor pair think what   what
Youre just doing the factors of 12 so what   what12
All right friends
You have factors right
Factors of 12 give me two
Yes my dear
Yes my dear
6 and 2
6 and 2
That works
Yes my dear
Yes my dear
3 and 4
3 and 4
We know 6 212
3 412
Are there more
Yes
Is there another one Zachary
4 3
4 3 and 3 4
We know those can go either way right
Do we have anything else
1 12
1 12
Excellent
Thank you friends
Now we have factors
Now whats this other one multiple
Would you please write the first three multiples of 12
You mean 12
No I mean well you may erase use this
When you think about multiples of 12 were going to say 12 1 is
12
12
Whats 12 2
24
How many multiples
Do the first three 12 3
Okay
T2 do you have the rag
I hope so
Were not supposed to just use that
All right
Factors and multiples do we need those for our strategies today
Good job having practiced with factors and multiples
Were going to move on to our journal now to learn those three big strategies
You may put away your whiteboard and marker
Take out your math journal and pencil
All right
Friends Do you have carpet spots
Yes
Please meet me on the carpet
With our journal
With your journal and pencil
Can you go borrow one from Morgan Stanley or Susan
We have to play here
Yes go ahead
What
Im sure someone in here can help you with that
Okay my friends we have three different strategies
The page that you need to go to is yes 156
My friends we have three strategies
Weve talked about a couple of them for how to get common denominators
Im actually going to go ahead and click over here on your strategy
I need T2s remote
Okay
Were going to look at strategy one and you can ignore the 12 24 and 36
Right here we are going to just jot down some notes on one of our strategies
Ready
One of the big strategies is make a list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find equivalent fractions with a common denominator
You have space to write that
The part I highlighted I want you to write that down right now
This is your resource that you can go back to and use
You mean the same thing
The same thing that they have written down you write down that exact same thing and this is your resource for your math journal
We provide all that
I would
Make a list of the equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find the equivalent fractions with a common denominator
Thank you Emma
Now lets practice this strategy that we just wrote down
Hold your hand up if you need more time just to write strategy one
Okay
Take a second to finish writing strategy one
Its okay
Ill give you some time in a second
Sorry that you guys have to be my guinea pigs today as I get back into the swing of things and teaching fifth grade
Currently T2 what Im looking for is a whiteboard screen and I know theres a way to do it I just know it
Well I dont want to open something new and I dont want to save something
What I want is just a whiteboard to write on
There we go
Now
How did you get that was it the easel looking thing
Yes
You do this and then
Then next to it is the Okay
Perfect
There are tryptase markers in all different colors right over there
Well in this one we could use the other markers too
Theyre right here
Whats our first strategy we have written down
Okay
What do you think of today
Very good
Okay
We are going to make a list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until you find what
An equivalent fraction
What if we were going to add 29  56
If you have 2956 and were going to use the equivalent fractions strategy
My friends I am doing number one and you can do it with us
Okay
Get your pencils ready
How do we find equivalent fractions for 29 and 56 so that we can add and subtract
Okay
Tim you may go up and show
Talk to us about how would you solve this with finding equivalent fractions so that they have common denominators
I start writing two fraction lists
You show me how you want to do it
Talk to us about what youre doing and why
Im starting 9 and then Im going up to 18 plus fraction
Im hearing Tim say hes listing the factors
Youre listing the multiples
Hes listing the multiples of 9
Then 6 12 18 and then
Wow did you see that Zachary
The way he just did that
I know that that would help a lot of kids in here
He wrote out the multiples of 9 and Fletcher wrote the multiples of 6 and then what was your next step
I circled them to make sure that
He circled what was the multiple that they both had
Now how is that going to help you get common denominators
Show us
How are you going to change those two fractions so that you can add them
Well
You just double that and then triple that
You do this three times and do that two times
Tell them what do you guys think will it work
Try it
Now
Talk to your classmates
You agree fifthgraders agree disagree would you do it the same way
I dont know
Call on someone
I agree because your strategy its sufficient
It might be the same answer that the teacher is going to give
I feel like its probably going to be a great answer
How do you know
Well because if you double the first one because theres two up there and triple that one
You plus the one and plus the one and youll get your answer
Chloe
I agree because it took me two multiples of 9 to get to 18 and even it had 29 2 and then took me 3 to get to 18 multiple of 6 and then get 3 6
Tim thank you for sharing your thinking
Lets see if we can get this to go back
Thats okay
We need to erase it first go back to where you were
Or you can just click the side
Click the side Tim
Then click  then click the erase
Click the erase and then yes
Perfect
Good job Quinn
All right my friends
Lets go try another one back on our whiteboard and then were going to come back to our journal
