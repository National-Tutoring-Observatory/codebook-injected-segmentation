Okay so today we are going to do a fold art
Its a coordinate graphing activity and if you remember with the sailboats they changed the rule and then we had to make a new sailboat
So if we look at our learning targets I can develop and apply a rule to enlarge a picture on the coordinate grid
I stopped here but I know I can understand this when I can take the original coordinate point and create a rule to make a larger picture
Everly
How long are we doing Lesson 4
When does it end
Well theres a day one and theres a day two but basically we dont need a full Math day to do day two
But is it like 413 that week
Start doing our four
Fourpoint test
test
Is it 410
Okay so we are on 410 weve done 411 and 412
Well do 413 and then we have the test after that and the time decimals and coordinate grids
Miss this should be a breeze
I love this
Not for Luke though
Listen
Pull your math journal without talking quickly and quietly
Without talking
And we are going to turn to page 142 actually 141
Okay and were going to look at logo
Who can read on page 141 the directions
Miss I can
Miss did you say 141
Grayson will you read it
Okay so you could look in there and you could find the points that she used to make this
Why is your math journal not out
Page 141
All right next part
Willow will you read the next part
Amy decides to waltz into the school lane so she needs to make the trapezoid wider she does not want it to be taller
She developed a rule to help her fix the drawing
Amys Rule
Okay Everly whats Amys rules
Where it says Amy
Its literally in bold
Just Amys rule
Other page
Wrong page
Wrong page
It says Amy
Double the first coordinate of all the points
Okay so which coordinate is that
Whats the first coordinate
It looks like your
Gabriel
Zero zero
Okay thats where they meet
Thats the origin but every time we write a coordinate which one is it Nova
Is it the x or the y
x
The x
The x coordinate is first
So every x coordinate shes gonna double
Double means what
Whats that mean Lincoln
Multiply by two
Multiply it by two
Just the x just the first number in the coordinate points shes gonna double that
Shes gonna multiply it by two
So she would double five times two which would be 10
So that itll be 10 then
Yes and youd leave the second one the same
The yaxis is all gonna stay the same
And remember in the sailboat we did that
We did that we just changed one of the axes to make a different sailboat
And some of them we did both
Okay number one
Lincoln do you want to read number one
Yes
If Amy uses her rule what do you think the new trapezoid will look like
Why
Be pacific in the description
Okay so what if she doubles it
Is it going to get taller
Is it going to get wider
Is it going to get taller and wider
Write down what you think is going to happen to the trapezoid
This is what you think
This is numbering with the one right
Yes number one and say why you think thats going to happen
Are these
Hunter what do you think will happen to this trapezoid if we just change the xaxis
You dont have the one l Just write what you think
I know you just got in here
Charlotte do you know if  since she just got here
Carter were on page 141
Okay so the rule she wants to change the xaxis
She wants to double it
So whats going to happen to this trapezoid
Is it going to get wider is it going to get taller is it going to get wider and taller
Whats going to happen to this trapezoid if we double the xaxis
Are we gonna have after recess
Are you going to make us go outside Ms Carroll
Theres kids out there
There are tiny children with  we have one back
Were good
Wow
Sorry
I got blubber
Hey
I get a word thing that shows the different words that are said
I dont want to see blubber
Thats not in your vocabulary
No seal blubber
Warm
Sure Sham warm
Maya what did you write
Whats your thoughts
Hey so you think its gonna get wider
Okay
Did anybody agree with Maya
I agree
Anybody have something different
Grayson what do you think
Actually I said I agree with Maya
Okay
Ruby what did you say
I say that it moves far to the right all the way to 104 and 100 because zero times two first of all is zero but five times two which is the second coordinate on the xaxis five times two is 10
Well move farther to the right
Are you agreeing with Maya
I am
Okay
But Ruby you only do the first one
Do you only do the
That guy right in front of me
Hey AJ wants to say something
What I said is I think you will look bigger and wider because usually when people say double that means like double the size
Like if you get a burger and McDonalds they say Double the size
Like Double the meat like usually that means bigger
So when it says double the first coordinate of all the points usually double means make it bigger
Okay and do you think its going to get bigger this way or this way or both
Wider
Okay
I said I think her new trapezoid
Excuse me
will get more wider
I think this because Amy created a rule that should make it wider
So she was the one that made a rule that should make her trapezoid bigger in width because she said she doesnt want it taller
She wants it bigger and she created a rule that should make it wider
Okay Willow
I wrote The trapezoid will be wider
She said she didnt want it to be taller
So it would have to be wider
All right
So lets turn to page 142 and number two Selena says what
142 yall
It says Use Amys rule to
I cant hear Selena
Use Amys rule to write the coordinates for the new trapezoid
Okay so youre gonna use Amys rules doubling the xaxis and write down the new coordinates
Fill out the table
This table right here doubling the Xaxis
0 x 2 is
Its about one stays the same
Were on page one 142
If we double the first one 0 x 2
3 x 2
No zero
This one stays the same and then you have the second number be the same
Do we just do
No
No
Just stop at number two
1 x 2 is 2 then you leave the four
We only do the first coordinate
Look you only do the first one
Thank for the information
Okay
Look you already have four and you stole
No I didnt
Yes
Okay
We are not eating
It is not snack time
Remember what I said were going to lose snack if we are eating whenever we want
Maybe you werent here to hear this
You know what to do
I can help her
Okay
You can help her
You can help if you know what to do
Were doubling this first numbers and then these stay the same
Okay
The rule was to double the first coordinates
0 x 2 is
Two
No
No
This one
1 x 2 is 2
Its two numbers
Its two zeros
No
No
We put the same here
You didnt do it
Okay
Who feels confident that they have all the points so everyone can check
Okay
Cora we havent heard from you
Lets hear yours
Wait
Before she says I might want you to check yours to see
If you agree give the the agree sign
00 24 104 100 00
Wait did you get that
Okay
Say it one more time
00 24 104 100 and 00
Okay
All right
Now number three Roman will you read number three
Work in your coordinates on the grid below
Connect to the points in the same order in the same order youve lost them
Okay
Lets just review real quick
What do we do first Asher
Zero
Zero
Okay
When youre plotting a point
Sorry
You do the X first she walked over and then you find the plotter
Then you find my plotter
You do X first and then Y and youve bought your point
You dont make lines
Some people Ive noticed they walked over they draw a line up
Those lines are going to cause you not to have the correct shape
You walk over then you climb up and you just put one point
You put one point
Basically if you feel the  paint the house
So you walked over to where you need
You walk up and then you put a splatter paint
Okay
If you make trapezoid okay I want to see the points
You make this trapezoid is it going to be the same as her last trapezoid
No
No
No
No
Whats going to happen to it
Its going to be wider
Alice
It doubles the size
It doubled the size
Whats it going to be
Wider
Wider
Okay
Draw your trapezoid
As you plot each point connect the dots
Not taller wider
Im surprised that its straight I mean thats still a trapezoid
Okay
The last one
Im going to start taking peoples snack that think that its snack time
Okay
Number five
Gabriella read number five
Number four sorry
Does the new trapezoid drop the way that you expected
Why or why not
You know you want it to
Be specific about how it changed
Okay
Write your thinking use as Josiah as many math vocabulary words as you can
Ms Carroll how many kids do we have in the class total
Theres this one thing in Rubys club and its like 10
I dont get it
What is it
Its like an organizer and it has different colors so we could write our numbers on it and then put our snacks in the drawers so that nobody else takes them and then they can put them in like one of the corners
We wont have them tempting on our desk or over there when they get stored over there so well just have them away from us
Good thinking
My dad wanted to buy it for the house but Im like we have six of those
Wait you have one of them every week
We have a bunch of them
Shes the only one who eating her snacks
Tell me why
Make sure that youre telling me why use some math vocabulary in your
You know what  rainbow thing that she uses except its a little bit bigger
I wanted to get it so then we can use it in here
Okay
For the rest of the math time we have about 20 minutes you were going to work on making a if you get Aaron do math boxes but you are going
to heres Connors original picture and youre going to go through the steps just like we did and youre creating a new one
What is it going to be
Listen for your voice level
A voice level where somebody in your team or next to you can hear you
Not shouting all the way across the room
We are going to be a one or a two at the most
Okay
More like a one
Okay
Let me talk with the two
During this time you may eat your snack but the expectation is this is done and turned in to your pocket by the time at 945
No were going to do silent reading because thats when I have to have a sub come in here for an hour
I know we can do that
I will set a timer so you can watch youre working on
I will stop you every time your voice level is too loud
Allison every time your voice is too loud Im going to stop you
Oh I want to try that
Hand me a popcorn
Okay Chris are we in a one
No
Now lets get down to zero
Try this again
We are working in a one voice level
Will you get Casey a folder
Or the larger one
Hello there
Miss Carroll
Do not talk to me  I have something times  letter
Can you be like  subtract
The multiples of seven or seventeens one is
Seven
Seven times two is
Oh wait I need a
Casey wants to do it anyway
Oh thats just the other
I agree
It just doesnt have anything in it
Great job with your one voice level
Do you want to do it larger
How would you do that
You know how I do
Not me
I dont understand
Today were not meeting in group
The only reason youll need your math book is if you get done with the green paper then you can get math
Oh Im already doing it
I thought youre just doing math here you are reading for your green paper
Thats what I was going at
To me itll be both ways
X and Y
What are those
Are those like a drink
I drink
Well what are the axis
You can double it
Number two it says be specific just like we were in the last one is whats going to get bigger
The width the height both
Those would be good math terms  excuse me
Those will be good math terms to use
Lets get started
I wonder the fun ones like that rocket ship dude except maybe if he
Your bomb or a sunglass
Oh you guys
Did you know
Is that connected
What
connected
Well because I forgot to  so now we have 15 minutes left
Is that connected to your computer or is it connected to that Epson thing on top
Is that a little computer in the middle
Whats your rule going to be
Those are not recording
My rules are Im just doubling it attached to this
Thats a hard way to say it  attached
Im just doubling now
Whats the rule going to be
What do you see at
The rule is to make it bigger right
Thats like bigger than my
Depending on what your rule is
Im I
Hey Lennon just looked at his and he said Wow thats a big coordinate grid
Yes
You might even be able to make your rule bigger than double
A triple
A drupel
No
by five
Itll be too big
Physical
What is that
It goes all the way to 25 x multiplying it by five  Mine is going to be very small compared to the
Got it
Copy that
I bet it if you did it just right
It just doubled up
Well that means you are ahead
Miss Carroll the site cant be reached
What site do you go to
I dont know
I dont go there anymore
