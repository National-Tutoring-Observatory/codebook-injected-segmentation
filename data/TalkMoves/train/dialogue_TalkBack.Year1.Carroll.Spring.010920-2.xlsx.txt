Except what they do with the little microphone on your desks
Okay
You guys watched the video right
Did everybody get to see the video
Okay
All right
Well maybe you didnt get to see it
What were going to be working on is octagon
Youre going to be working on comparing decimals
I can use place value strategies to compare decimals to the thousandths
Ill give you two different strategies
Im going to share one with you and then Im going to show you what this paper that I gave you how it can be helpful
Okay
Youre going to look at each place values starting up with tenths
The tenths is where
You have your desk Mo where is the tenths
Is it the first one the second one the third one
Its the first one
Okay
Youre going to compare it to the other number
Youre going to look at both numbers in the tenths
If one is bigger then that numbers bigger
If theyre the same then you go to the hundredths
Okay
If theyre the same then you go to the thousandths
As soon as one is bigger then that makes that number bigger
Okay
What is the kinds of  The first part put the number and then a dot
It is a decimal and then the other three it was saying like the first number is that number
If its like a nine and then the other one is a seven then nine is biggest no matter what
You dont have to worry about the other numbers
Okay
The first one we have 34hundredths and we have 248thousandths
Okay
I want you to start which one is bigger
Seven
Its on your paper
Its the first one
Everybody look at the first one
Which is bigger 34hundredths or 248thousandths
Hold on
Were going to pass this around and then say it in this
I think you can split the 248thousandths
Im going to say
Is that your race
Catalina is that your race assignment
Is there an easy way you get her the homework 44
Im going for 0248
Okay and which one did you say Andy 248
Im going for 248
What
Okay
Melly
Which one figure
Which one 248thousandths or 34hundredths
34hundredths
Okay
34hundredths
248thousandths
34thousandths
You dont have one
Is it this top one
34hundredths or 248thousandths
34thousandths
Okay
Give it to Frankie
Okay
All right
We had mixed answers
What were going to do on this paper that I gave you is we are going to color with three different colors and then were going to see if we have the same answer
Okay
Yes on this
On the first one take your first color and if in the tenths place we have three for 34hundredths
Color three tenths
Thats a whole row
For 34hundredths were following three tenths
We need three whole rows
Does it matter with the little lines
See how were doing Mia
I know but this if were going to ever use most
We will
Okay
Then once you have your three rows in your first color your second color youre going to do four boxes
Okay
All like you were doing but now four of them
Let me show you one
Theres one of them
Like that
Im going to do four of those
Okay
Right there thats 34hundredths
All right
Now were going to do 248thousandths
How many long ones do we have to do
Two
Two
Well now were in a new box
Right next to it were going to do two
Two full rows because this one in the tenth it shows two
Were going to do two full rows
Okay lets keep going
Okay
After that how many boxes are we going to color next with a different color
Four boxes
Four boxes
Okay
Now this one we didnt have any ittybitty tiny ones but this one we do
Eight
Okay
Were going to do eight ittybitty ones
Itty bitty lines
See thats two
The lines
The ittybitty boxes
Okay
Ittybitty thats tiny ones
Okay
Now were going to go around to here and I want you to look at it and see which has more
If this was a cake which person has more cake
Either this one
Were going to say this is 34hundredths or 248thousandths
Okay
The first one
Which is
Okay
The first one
Okay
First one
First one
The first one
The first one
The first one
First one
Second one
Second one
Okay
Lets look at this
In our cake we have three full rows
This one we only have two rows
Doesnt this one have more
This one has three full rows
Do you see it
Okay
Here when we go back to this paper 34hundredths is bigger
When we go to this paper and we said this even though she picks the other one both times she said this you look at the first number
Which ones bigger
The three or the two
Three
Three
Right there that tells us that ones going to be bigger
She said she saw that in the video and then she picked a two
No I thought
I thought when I was  I thought I did three on this one and two on this one
Okay so on the alligator mouth which decimal is bigger were going to put the alligator mouth facing the 34
Honestly what I learned about fractions  What I learned about fractions is that sometimes throughout the year the smaller number is sometimes the bigger number
Because just now 34 was bigger than 248
Smaller it is I guess bigger it is
Well in this case it does 34 does look smaller but in the video they also talked about if theres nothing there you can put a zero there and now 340 Shirley is bigger than 248
If I add a zero there okay so how did we know that this one was bigger
Because of do you want strike that
No I want you to tell me why
Oh because
Shes telling us what we should write
Well so I think what we should write is that 34 zero decimal wait how else we say that
This is thirty four hundred
Oh yes 34hundredths is bigger than 248thousandths because when we wrote down on the grades it showed that there was three rows and
the The second grade that we did was two rows of boxes and a row of tinny boxes but even thought that the second number is bigger the first number was Even though the second number is bigger the 248 is bigger than 34 then in on decimalwise 34 was bigger than 248
Right so
Thats a lot to write but
Yes thats so Im going to condense it down
Looking at the three in the tenths is bigger than the two in the tenths and that would show that there and here so here is what I want you to write
Are you ready guys
The three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths of 24thousandths
It is bigger than what
Than the tenths
Okay so the three in the tenths of 34hundredths is bigger than the two in the tenths
tenths of
Okay so I put it right there so you guys can see it
Okay so were going to look at the next one
We have one and two tenths and 25hundredths
So which one is bigger
This time well start with Dangelo and well go this way
Wait what
Which one is bigger than the one and the two tenths or 25hundredths
Wait can you come back soon I want to do it on here
Okay the problem with doing it on here is theres a whole number so youre going to have one whole box and then two long ones and this one you have Okay
Leahs going to start
I think the first one now
Lets start
but the  is there
I think the second one
I think the second one
I think the first one is more involved
I think the first one
The first one
The first one
The second one
The first one
I think the second one
The first one
I think the second one
Okay
All right so let me show you on our thing where the first mic
Okay so on my grid for the first one Im going to have to color one whole because it has one and two tenths so this is just one and then the other one is 20
So the whole box
The whole box plus two more and the other one The other one looks like this
Heres the first one both of these boxes and heres the second one
The first one has a whole box and then part of the box and then this one just has two more
Speaker 2 This got the whole box
MsCarroll This is a whole thing
First is this so this is a whole This is one and two tenths
Isaiah are you done and youre done with all of yesterdays pages too
Okay so the first one is bigger because it has a whole number so we know that one is bigger because it has a whole number
All right now using this put them in order from biggest to smallest
Which one out of these four is the biggest
Write that first
so do you know
Right
Down here it says then smallest From largest to smallest
Youre going to put them in order and then heres the table
If the table helps you its right here
Okay so right here Cardo were doing this one right here
Is it
Oh yes
This needs to be fixed
The decimal is in the wrong place
Okay so I want you guys to fill up this down here
The very bottom one
Okay so you can this and you can use your paper so you start here
Is there any that are bigger than any others
One
Okay so thats your first biggest ones
You got to put 12
No it goes the decimal is before it
Okay when you have that done you can hand it to me okay because I want to look at it and make sure youre doing it right
The thing is the biggest numbers
Okay with that you can go back to your seat
Is it okay that first off why did you Then you offered here
Yes
