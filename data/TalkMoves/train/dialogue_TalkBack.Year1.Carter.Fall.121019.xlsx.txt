So we have one team that theyre confused about their homework
They would like to come for a group with it
Do we have somebody thats feCharlieng confident about their homework to give us and explain their thinking for us
Wow nobody is feCharlieng confident
I know we had a substitute yesterday but I know Angel said some things contently weve been interacting with
Yes its okay
Yes there you go thank you
Lots of volunteers now
Marvin can you come up and show yours please
Give a round of applause for our volunteer
Were watching to see what his thinking is were not working in our math journals or that ladies
What I did was because she said that the real house looks about twice as wide as it is high so shes trying to say that she wants the house to be wider so I said you can multiply the first coordinate on the Xaxis by two and the new coordinates with 04 and then 00
Then I double the Xaxis coordinate so 4x2 is 8 then 4x2 is 8 and then 2x2 is 4
Then I kept the Yaxis coordinate the same
Because
Because were not going to make it tSSer were just going to make it wider
Shelby and you dont like this why
I feel like the house looks like it is about twice as wide as it is high
I think its in double both numbers in here
Lots of people are not agreeing with you
Pick somebody thats not agreeing with you to respond to you
I reSSy didnt think it was just wider or tSSer
I just thought we had to make it bigger
Can you go back to the prompt to help us see that
Read that for us Marvin
Aster made a giant rubber house on a coordinate that she said that the real house looks like its about twice as wide as it is high
Her brother said she could change her picture to make it look like a real house
What should the picture look like
What are the keywords there
Everybody look and see what are the keywords to help you see how to modify this
I like the way people are looking at their work on the board or theyre looking at their own homework
What are the keys to tell you how to modify this
Share with your shoulder partner
Partner A shares their thinking
What are the keywords here River
Twice as wide as it is high
What does that mean
Keep the height the same and make it twice as wide
Do we agree with that
SS right and so any other questions about this
Team four do you get it now
Yes
Rylee whats still confusing you
I just dont know how I got done
Because Marvin is right there
You what
I just dont get
What could we ask Rylee to help him understand this
Does it have to be just related to todays homework to help him understand this
Think about any of the lessons weve been doing what could we ask him about that would help him understand this
Stormy
Which axis would you multiply to make it wider
Xaxis
What do you think
What do you think
Do you agree with this answer
Let me know
There is your feedback Rylee
Thats the one that you want to make twice as big as the original
Thats just what Marvin did SS right
A round of applause
Id like you to please leave your paper where its at and join me on the front
Thanks for getting here quickly
This was the problem that you were doing yesterday
This is the problem art he wants to make a picture on his reading folder and he wants it to look still like this booklet
He wants to make it larger so that its not more noticeable on his notebook
You guys remember that
Yes
Okay
Where are my handydandy
Book
What do you think a good response would include to this problem
What would you need to do in order to have a good response to this
Now Im just going to jot down your ideas on a sticky note that we can throw under here
What would a good response include
This was one of the questions
Lets read it together
Write a rule that Justly can use to make the picture of the book larger
Read this question
Describe what you think the new picture will look like
Be specific about how you think the book will change
Thinking about those two questions what would we be looking for in an answer
Need your elbow partner
Raise your hand if you dont have an elbow partner
So then Makou will be Rebecca partner
There your partner can just come up and talk with Stevie
There we go
Talk with your partner what are we looking for in order to have a good answer for this response so far
Ready
Go
Okay thank you
What will the response include so far
Ready Ansley
You have to answer any questions
Can you talk about question one first so that we can go in order please
In question one we will have to be specific
We cant just say double the coordinates like you would end up doubling the Yaxis or Xaxis
Okay so a specific rule to make the picture
Yes
Anybody want to give any feedback on that
Are you agreeing
Thank you
What about number two what are we looking for there
Charlie
What youre looking for there is what you think the book actuSSy look like and how you think the book will change
So describe the picture and it says Be specific about how you think the book will change what do you mean by that
These details about how you think the book will change
What do you think of that
Anything else people want to add for either one of those
Im just jotting them down on the sticky notes so we can Asterluate some work together
I guess I should be putting this on the chart because its going to be hard to see it when we are looking at work
I will have to try to splitscreen but well see
Lets go to this next part what do you need to do in order to make the prompt for this component
Talk with your elbow partner
Okay Hunter what needs to be on here in order to make the prompt
You have to
What are those items in between the parenthesis cSSed again
Coordinates
Yes the ordered pairs of coordinates
What would we be looking for
Help him out partner
Double the first one there
Do they have to be doubled
They just have to be larger according to the prompt so the coordinates are accurate and make the picture larger
It doesnt have to be double they just have to be larger
They need to be accurate and larger
Anything else that people think for this
Milan
You have to remember to write the parenthesis and the comma
Okay so parenthesis and comma for the ordered pair
Phyl
ActuSSy make it follow your rule like two times the original
Okay follows the rule that you wrote nice thank you
Anything else
Charlie
How many plotted lines are there
First of SS this is use your rule so write the new coordinates so lets just stay there
Now go on to the next part read number four
Plot the coordinates from a new book on the next screen
Connect the points in the same order that you plot them
Stop and think what are you looking for in order for it to be a good answer to the problems
Sutton
You need to make sure that connect the points in the same order
What do you think
What do you think
Thank you
What else
What else
Isabel
If these are the coordinates here when I plot them whats important to make sure happens
That they go in order
Okay thats true youre going to do them in that order
What else are you going to do about these coordinates to make sure that they are following your rule
Plot the coordinates for the new book
Make it more tSSer
They actuSSy make it larger
What else though
Talk with your partners what else are we looking for when they plot these coordinates
Hey back to me
Sandra what are we looking for about them plotting the coordinates
We need to make sure that the coordinates
I hear you saying we need to make sure that theyre plotted correctly and accurately would that be the same
Theyre plotted correctly and accurately what did you want
to add
Make sure youre plotting them based on the rule
Yes based on what youve written
SS right what do you think Im thinking
You guys are slow here today give me feedback so we can move along thank you
Number five read it
Compare your predictions in problem two to the new picture
How was your prediction correct
How was your prediction incorrect
What would you need to do in order to be proficient with this
Claud
Compare your predictions with problem two
Yes actuSSy answer these two questions
When you answer these questions what would make them good answers
Talk with your elbow partner about that please
Back to me please
Leslie thank you
What would we be looking for for your answers to these questions
You would be looking for to check if your plots matched the actual
I think thats another question I agree that youre going to do that but thats a different question
How are your answers to these questions going to be good answers
What are we looking for for a good answer of how your prediction was correct how was your prediction incorrect
What are we going to do that make sure that those answers are clear to our reader
To compare them
Okay actuSSy answering the question yes
What are we looking for
You actuSSy answer the questions but what are we looking for that helps us answer the questions correctly
What are we going to use that helps us be clear to our reader
Reasoning
Our reasoning good
What else
What else
Help her out find somebody thats showing you this to help you out
Charlie
I like your thinking and I think you could use details of the instruction and complete sentences
Okay so detailed
How can we be detailed
What helps us be detailed
Stevie
Because youre already more proficient and now youre improficient and explain how you are
What Im looking for here is math vocabulary
Youre using words like Xcoordinate Ycoordinate ordered pairs so the math vocabulary
You guys are on the right track youre just not stating it as clear as I would like
Make sure youre using math vocabulary
So restating the prompt
Yes restating the prompt
How my prediction was correct is good
SS right so now weve got a list what were you looking for or good answers here
Lets look at some work
Where is it
Heres someones actual work and I already see some people questioning some things
No
No
Talk with your elbow partner what did you notice about this part
Back to me please
Dylan what observations did you and your partner have about this work
the exact same size or smSSer and why do we need it because unless youre closer to that
Okay but if you look back at the prompt it didnt say where it needs to be it just said he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder so is it breaking the rule to have it there
No
No so yes looks like its the same size I agree its supposed to be larger
What would you like to add Milan
I was going to say that if you send that
Im sorry it was Vanessa that still had her hand up
Sorry
I see what Rose was thinking in the middle because if youre timesing it like lets say the bottom coordinate was  if youre timesing that by two its going to be  so its going to start on the bottom
When youre timesing your coordinates you have to plot it according to the coordinates that you plot on your grid you cant have it floating in the air because that not possible because one of your coordinates
Okay so I want to ask you is if somethings larger but in a different location does that mean that it doesnt fit the rule that they ask for
Lets go back to that original question
I think its over here
No its over here
No its right here
After drawing the picture Justly decides he wants to put a picture of a larger book on his folder
Does it say that it has to start on these same coordinates in order to be larger
No
No
No
It could be on any point
It could be on any coordinates as long as its larger
I know but how can they be tiny multiplying the coordinates and still have it like if you were timesing one of the coordinates
Multiplying
Multiplying it could give a totSSy different location
I get how it would be larger but I dont know how itd be
Thats a great question
Everybody think about it
Everybody think about how could you make this bigger but change the location
How can you make this larger lets even just say twice as large just for arguments sake how can you make this twice as large but put it in a different location
Talk with your elbow partner about your idea
Ready
Go
Okay back to me please
Kirby what did you and your partner decide
We decided it doesnt matter wherever it is when youre following the instructions telling you what to do
Okay good youre on the right track but how could I move that and make it twice as large
Like this right here from here to here is how many sections wide so far
From here to here how many sections are they showing
Its one so we want it to be how many sections wide
Two but where will we put it then
We know that its going to have to be two sections wide so can you make this larger but just put it at different coordinates
Yes
Milan
Im sorry Vanessa
Im just still a little confused how you can move it because we were thinking for example if you look at the coordinate thats
If youre doubling both of those you can move it because that would  so you can move it
Were confused because some of them are zero coordinates and you cant multiply zero its still going to be zero
Thats what we were thinking
Theres no way to move it off that the lines there because its always going to stay in that zero because you cant multiply it
If you multiply zero by anything its always going to be zero
Okay but Sandra respond to her
If you add instead of multiplying if you change your rule to adding adding something to zero will make it one or two or three or four so you could move it instead of making it bigger
This needs it in terms of getting larger or its not even larger
No
The fact that its in a different location does that change this persons work
No
No
The part that doesnt work is that they kept it the same
SS they did was move its location in the coordinate plane so thats not meeting the objective
I heard somebody saying the dots are too big
Does it matter what size
No
No theyre definitely on the coordinate they just are emphasized
The problem is its not twice as large
SS right lets look at the next one
Lets read this
This was where you read a rule Justly used to make the picture that was larger
Read the rule with me
Justly can multiply the Xcoordinate by six
Okay I think my contact might be in bathroom six
The tunnel looks like a pipe too
Yes
Look and see
Did this person make it larger
Yes
I see some people that I missed
Ryan
He did make it larger but if he was going to only multiply the Xcoordinate that would only make it wider and not forward
He meant to say what
Multiply the X and Y axis by six
So he wasnt as detailed as he should be right
Lets look at this next one
Describe what you think the new picture will look like
Be specific about how you think the folder will change
The folder will be
Read it with me
The folder will be tSSer
Is it just tSSer
No
Wider
Its tSSer and wider yes
Lets look now at this rule
Looks like he multiplied it by six right
Yes
Thats five six
Yes he multiplied both coordinates by six so he was not specific up here
Those two things hes a little confused but this part he actuSSy made the coordinates following a different rule to what he wrote so would he be proficient
No
No but he did reSSy make me work
Lets look at this one
Talk with your elbow partner what you notice about the
Lets hear one of your observations Isabel
Its tSSer and not wider
Did it have to be tSSer and wider
No
No it just had to be larger so would you say that this is larger
Yes
Yes so that would work
What else did you notice Brendan
The reason it was correct it got tSSer on the bottom
Thats not reSSy explaining how your prediction was correct or how it was incorrect
Hes just giving us five to six more or less on how it was correct
Thats not reSSy telling you how it s correct
Hes just saying it was correct it got tSSer
Hes supposed to explain how it got tSSer and how he got his rule and how the prediction was correct instead
Hes not reSSy explaining how his prediction is correct
I see a lot of people agreeing with you
Thank you
Lastly there should be one more observation
Whats the other observation Leslie
The other observation was that well its good overSS but they could
Tune here Leslie right here
They forgot to include how it was incorrect
They just said how it was correct
I see a lot of people nodding their heads thumbs up
Yes you need to make sure you address that
If there was nothing incorrect you still say that
Based on my prediction it came out the way I expected
I didnt see anything that was different so that you at least address the answer to the question
I get what Im looking for
I have questions about it
Today Ill flip
Nice I pushed the wrong button sorry
Im out of practice being gone one day and look what happens
Hold on
Lets go back to the learning intention here
I can discuss other Ss roles and pictures on the coordinate grid and revise my work
Remember the word revise means to relook at something and make changes
Where else do you use revision in your life
Do you think you can think of some other ways that we look at something and make changes
If you always talk first you talk second
Talk with your partner how did you revise your work
Get back to me please
Thank you
Asher where else do you use revision in your life
I use revision when Im writing to revise if I make a mistake in my wording or if I just make a mistake
I see a lot of people agreeing with you
Thank you
Kerry whats another way you use revision in your life
When you give me high scores and maybe youre just trying something new like in one of those sports you said if youre trying because first you get it wrong and then eventuSSy you get it right
I love your thinking
I love your example
Coachable people definitely use revision in their sports
Definitely
Josiah whats another example
What did you and your partner talk about
Whenever youre drawing something or painting something if you mess it up then you could always revise it
If you see something wrong you could erase it or make changes to it
Great example
Anybody has one that wasnt mentioned that theyd like to share
Alison
Another example of revision is when you are camping if you get a screwup you can go back and revise
Make it right
Thank you
Whats another example Carolyn
I ll say buying from the grocery store and you have the grocery store list and you just ran out of a certain item and you forgot to put on the list you revise the rest after youve done that
Thank you
Great examples
I think weve got this concept of revision
Revision means to relook at it and make some changes
Today for success criteria lets read this together
You need to understand others thinking to get answers to the questions harder at work make revisions see past lists of what other response would include
I jotted down here smart thinking from our lesson I will magnify it just to make sure you can read what Ive written here so good response
Reads with me
In a separate row make a picture
Beside the picture details about picture looks coordinate accurate for larger
You guys said they need to have parentheses and commas
What they cSS a cross
Connect points in same order needs to be larger correctly or accurately made
Answer the questions
Youre going to have two answers Leslie
Restate the problems reasoning detail and the amount of
Can you guys see that if I leave that up there to check your work today so you can make your revisions
Hows this
Is that too bad
What if I do it this way
Is that better
Like this
Yes
Or a little smSSer
Yes
Like this
If you need to come up here to look at this feel free to
Theres one paper without a name so if you dont get your paper back its yours
When youre finished working today revising your work go ahead and go to your paper from knock boxes and thats journal pages that you were given yesterday please
I dont get what to do I have questions
Ready go
Thank you
Remembering you re using a different writing material so I can see the difference between your original work and your revised work
Is that yours or not
Or is it Blakely
Ive passed every paper I had back so if you dont have yours look for it because they were not turned in then
Theres this  paper
Put some of the  writing like this
that want to group come and get a copy because theres three of them
Just come get paper here
Theres three papers
Im pretty sure this is it
Theres three papers
Theres the
Just get what you need
Theres this paper
This one has
No like this
Do you see how
Thank you
Did you guys turn in your work yesterday like you usuSSy do in class where the team leader turns them SS in or did you walk over and independently turned it in
Independently turned in
Why are you breaking the rules when Im not here
Because now someones paper is missing
This is  and not collect any work from people and now someone is missing their work
Should you follow the way we do things even if Im not here
Yes
Ask yourself is your work getting accomplished
This isn t the last one
What do you have so far
Oh my God
Thank you
please stand
Thank you
intention in  we were supposed to be able to discuss other Ss their roles their pictures to help you revise your work
You will be looking at it so that you can make improvements or changes
You had to be able to understand other peoples thinking
Were looking for clear answers to the questions
On your work
Pack your work that you made revisions and you were using this list that we  created in order to help you make those revisions
How well did you make the learning intention today
Thank you
Please make sure that team leaders get the work turned in
If you are not finished consider it homework
I had several people that were finished with math box and math journal work
If you would please stack your math journal over here
This should  for me so I can start working on
Thank you
join me on the
