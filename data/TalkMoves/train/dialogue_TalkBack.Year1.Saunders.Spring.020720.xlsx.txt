All right ladies and gentlemen
You should have your journal in front of you
All right right now the plan for that quiz is probably to requiz Monday
I would highly recommend that you go through those  between now and Wednesday
Lets see
Both Amara and Cassidy and Briella are all in the photo here from yesterdays swim meet
Its cool
Do you guys
All right
You should be on page 95 in your journal
Lets get on page 95
Were almost a third of the way now
There you go
A third sounds about right
All right eyes upfront please
In red up here instead of calling things turning points what have we been calling them
Vertices
Not zeros because zeros are Xintercepts
Remember for polynomials how many of these vertices do we have
As many as you want
Yes
Yes
There could be more than one
We dont call them vertices we call them
Turning points
Turning points
We use the word local
Local min and max
Local min and max
What weve been calling this has been local mins and maxes
Same idea a turning point
What could you say happens at a turning point
In your teams talk about some ideas
What happens at a turning point
A change in direction
Lets say its going down
Right
Has the idea of a direction change
The slope is changing
Were going from maybe going down to going up
We want to talk about those a little bit
There is just one exploration here
Lets see
Seth could you read the instructions from the board for exploration one
Work with a partner
At each polynomial function with its graph  points of the graph of the function
Round your answers to the
nearest onetenth
All right
The idea here is that everybody learns how to find the local mins and maxes using a calculator
Everybody should grab a calculator either your own or one out of the cabinet
If you dont have enough for everybody then take turns working with that
Are we going to have a little section on the test because we were thinking about
No
I still want to make sure you know how to do this
Yes yes
You originally wanted this test to have a calculator section
I lost you
You cut to the chase
It was exactly what I was wondering
Miss  should have a say in this
Were the ones
The thing here is concepts
Can you properly understand the concept
No I cant
Well between now and Wednesday I hope your answer changes
Sometimes I have to check if Im right
Heres the problem with a multiplechoice question
I might say give you a thing like X2  5X2 and ask you to do something with that
Or whats the Yintercept
Well because you could use a calculator and figure that out not that you wouldnt know it anyway but then I have to figure out well how do I mask a specific case and ask a question thats a general case
Then I would have to say Well if the polynomial is in the form ABX  times CD how would you determine what the Yintercept is
The question actually becomes harder which is not a bad thing necessarily
Yes
Yes
Maybe its just a regular graph on the level three
I dont know why thats an issue
Some Ms Saunderss say Well I didnt have a classroom sample
Figure out how to get a sample
I have so many
All right
Start by figuring out how to match them
Dont use the calculator to match them
Use the calculator to check your
For A and not C
Is there  as
I have not seen that there wasnt
Though I could die
I wish it would keep snowing
Ladies and gentlemen the answers are on the board
See if you can improve either exploration one or improve what you wrote for the communicate your answer
All right eyes up front please
Were going to move into the first concept summary
Youll see this in your journal
If you would go and just flip over to the one that says zeros factors solutions and intercepts
What Id like you to do is simply go round the table each person taking a turn starting with the opening paragraph and walking down through each of these
Then also talk about what a root means
Lets have the person closest to the door start
Go ahead and start with the intro to that
Lets wait until we are done with our discussion here if you dont mind
Ladies and gentlemen open up your textbooks to page 168
Page 168
Textbook page 168
Eyes at upfront please
Example one
Brad could you read the title of example one
Push the title
Using
Amara read the function itself
What function
Yes
Yes
Which one
F of X equals
F and X equals AX
Are on page 168
F of X equals
All right
Below what are the Xintercepts
The Xintercepts are 3 and 2
Brandon what happens at two for this particular one
What happens at two for that particular one
It starts increasing
It starts increasing so it goes from decreasing to increasing
What else would you say Caitlin
What happens when X equals two
The graph will get thinner
The graph will get thinner
Aiden
It hits a local minimum
It hits a local minimum and its a turning point
Whats also true about that what have we said right from the beginning
How did we describe whats happening right here
After 1X
We use that term that its bouncing so it represents multiplicity
So in your teams talk about what does multiplicity mean what we have multiples of talk about it in your team
Well if this is called multiplicity what do we have multiples of
Of zeros
We have multiple zeros
We have multiple zeros that are equal
We have more we have multiplicity
Anytime that we have a exponent here weve got multiplicity
We have multiple roots factors Xintercepts that are identical
What happens if its an even number
It bounces off
It bounces off
Were making that connection here
Now some of you during the quiz had asked me is it okay that we just draw these turning points in wherever
If I know that thats a Yintercept and thats a Xintercept could I just come up here and come down there
Or could I come up way high and come down through that there
We didnt talk about how just figure out the shape that goes in between those Xintercepts
Now whats the simple solution
Plotting points
Yes
Yes
Pick a couple of points in between
If I know that those are my two Xintercepts lets pick up enough points that we can characterize what that curve looks like to be more accurate
All right weve talked about end behavior a lot
Brad what do we look for with regards to end behavior
What tells us what end behavior is
If its going up and down
Up and down
What would I look at in this to tell me about my end behavior
If the X value is positive
Tell me how I figure out that the X value is positive
The leading coefficient
Theres my leading coefficient
If I multiply this times this times this because theres two I still have a positive leading coefficient
Andy whats the positive leading coefficient tell me
Onesixth
Yes the one six
What does that tell me
It tells you that its going to be straight on the vertical
Okay so how about the end behavior
How does that tell me about end behavior end behavior
Think about that
At the ends you think
infinity
Okay lets just take that first statement as X does what
As X goes towards infinity whats happening to Y
You cant really go towards a number that doesnt exist because its
Sure you can
You just keep going
Because its just a little bit bigger and just a little bigger and just a little bigger
Youre not getting any closer to it though
Youre still going for towards it
It does tell you about direction
It goes infinitely
What would the next statement then be Ethan
As X goes towards negative
Why dont you just say as X decreases Y increases
Thats a specific format for end behavior
It is yes
In fact if you look in the textbook youll see that they use that format over and over to talk about end behavior
You see its looking kind of like this
This is what I would like you to talk about
In your teams take a look at everybody knows goes and youre going to be the starter for this
Youll take that first bullet and just answer them and then just go around your team taking each of those and answer it
Go ahead and get started
What caused Y to be zero
Those are my Xintercepts
Because I have 2 I have X2 and X2
I have the solutions 3 two and two
Its repeated
So theres a different characteristic here
Were bouncing off the Xaxis with an even value and itll go through if its odd
All right so most of us are in groups of four
Those of you that arent you have to adjust
I want each of you to take in one of these and walk through all of the sentence steps
Right so youre going to take turns
Somebody can just choose to start with number one and talk about all of those and so give that person feedback
Are they on track
Do they need some coaching to change the answer here
Go ahead and decide who starts this is important
Im really sorry for being annoying
All right ladies and gentlemen any questions on these
Is there any way you can
From these whats always true about the Yintercept
In other words 12x1x4x4
Theyve gotten rid of the square
All right well pick up on Monday  finishing this
Also do 39 on Monday
If you would please turn off the microphones but leave them in the book
