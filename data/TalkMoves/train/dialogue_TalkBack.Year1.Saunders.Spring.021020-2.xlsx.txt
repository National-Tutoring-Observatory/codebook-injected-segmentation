Wednesday
All right
Today Today were going to finish up materials for the test on Wednesday
Theres really only one big idea for the new material and several smaller ideas that well go through
But if you recall on Friday we ended up with this weve gone and done one goround for them
I want to revisit that to help get our minds back around this
Now the value of being able to do this is if youve been given a graph and you have to come up with the equation or youve been given the equation and youre coming up with the graph
At the end you should be able to put the graph and the equation side by side walk through these and make sure theyre matching
In other words this is the way you can check your answer to make sure your graph and your equation are matching no matter which direction you go from graph to equation or equation to graph
It becomes important to understand each of the concepts
Weve got four so were actually going to do this as a team activity but I dont want you to move your desks just leave your desks where they are
Person number one for example would be
Louis
Two three four
One two three four
It doesnt matter if you start but person number one you have the first equation
You dont have to go first if somebody else wants to jump in there and go first
While youre listening to the other person you need to be doublechecking to make sure theyre getting the concepts right so that by the time you have the four gorounds everybody had been reinforced in their understanding of these ideas
All right
How am I going to know when youre done
We stand up
Stand up
Yes
When your team is done and youve gone through all four of those go ahead and stand up and that will just be my way of telling that you guys are on task and are done
It doesnt matter who starts but according to your seat number youve got that equation so go ahead and get started
The four of you guys are talking to
Four
Four
Why do you have number four
I think its one or the other so there are is it three six
Itd be two negative one would be negative if you stick the same thing its going to be one and four
We need to stand up
We do
Were going to pay attention
All right
Person number one survey your team
Is there anything we need to talk about as a class
No
All right
Any questions
No we dont have any questions
Brad
Were good
Were good
Jeff
All right anybody else have questions
I need help with
You got a question
All right
Is there a question
Go ahead read
Well take
I forgot how to do that but theres
This part right here
Yes
If its a linear equation do the ends of a line go in opposite directions or the same direction
Opposite
They go opposite so a line either goes that way and that way or that way and that way
Now what if its a quadratic
Its a parabola so the ends of that parabola are either pointing up or pointing down
If its to the first degree so x to the first is a linear were doing this if its quadratic were doing this if its cubic if its quartic and it just keeps going like that right
Yes
Which one were you working on
Were you working on this one
Three
Three
Yes
Okay
Whats the degree of that one
It is three
Three
Three
Is that an odd or even number
Its odd
Is it going in the same or different directions
It is going in different
How do I know whether its going like that or like that
If its positive or negative
In this case this one is
It is positive
Positive
Were looking at that leading coefficient basically itll be positive
Is it doing this or this
Its going like that
Going like that
Okay so if its going like that how many different directions do the cubic go
Is it three
If I draw my curve how many directions do the cubic go
Two
Four
Three
Four
Three
One two three
Theres my direction
All right so now read
Now were ready to answer the question
Yes
As x goes to negative infinity so lets just say thats my xaxis so x is going in that direction where are my ys going
Id like to believe down negative
Okay
As x goes towards negative infinity y is also going to negative infinity
In this case as the xs get bigger and are going towards infinity my ys are going to positive infinity
Why
Thats for this particular one
Okay
All right so what youre thinking of right here is as x basically goes far left y is going down
So whats the answer
As x is moving towards negative infinity y is going to
Negative
Yes because the graph is going down like that
If I go all the way over here as x is getting really positive what are my Y values doing
Theyre going to positive
Theyre getting really positive
Do you have a question
No
All right
Any other questions
All right
Lets be on page 98 of the journal
Open your journal
Thank you
All right
Theres ESYELL facilities
All the Tshirts youre choosing yellow
Grant you didnt commit and our team decided to use that system
So he comes and watches you give us your sentence
All right Location Principle
Lets see how well John can read the location principle
Go John
Go John
I dont know
If f is a polynomial  and then n be  number such that
f of a
Hes stupid
Im
Youre done so quickly
All right Layla help him out
f0 and f0 then  a tleast one real zero between the digits
All right now thats kind of mathy gobbledygook
I tried to create a picture to show what this is saying
For example if f if this y value is greater than zero then y has to be
Positive
This is where y is positive
Anywhere in this pink range is where y is positive
B could be any number positive or negative the x value but the y is going to be positive so its a point somewhere in here
Then over here theres this function where were putting A in and our answer is always going to be a negative number
Its some number where y is negative so its somewhere down here
Theyre not necessarily in that order or even in these quadrants they could be here and here or there or there it doesnt matter but the idea is that there is a real zero in other words one of those things thats going to be in between the x values
B would be here and A would be there
Somewhere in between A and B theres an X intercept
Why do we look at all that long explanation for a simple principle about this
Again this is about understanding relationships of graphs and equations
If I know that I have two points like this I know that in between them there has to be an X intercept
If I were looking at a calculator table so weve put that into our y1 field and I notice a negative y and a positive y right here next to each other just like this was talking about a positive Y and a negative Y if I notice that in a table I know somewhere in between there the y value has to be zero
If y is zero then what I found is an xintercept
Thats just a way graphically using a graphing calculator
Since as you know you cant have a graphing calculator for the test were not going to spend a lot of time on this but I wanted you to start to see that idea and this one right here
All right lets just read number one
Melinda could you read number one
On the graph every point  because the outcomes are most n minus one for any
All right
Whats in italics up there is important
If I have a degree and I call that degree n so now its like this
Whats the degree in this
Three
Probably three right
One two three directions
If n is three 31
Two
Two points
Two
I have one two turning points
Its at most two because yx3 would actually be something that looks like that and we dont really see a turning point we see a little shift happening but it doesnt really turn all the way around
Thats why that italicized word becomes important
If n is three I have at most n minus one or two turning points
Any questions on that one
Faith could you read number two please
If a polynomial approaching  n distance through zero  is graphed as exactly n minus one turning points
A zero they use that term a lot but it just simply means an
xintercept
Xintercept
If I have three xintercepts 31 is
Two
I have exactly two turning points
What would the degree of this likely be
Four
Four
Four
41 is
Three
41
Three
It has one two three turning points and this could be a one two three four five fifthdegree
It has exactly
Six
51
Four
Four turning points so we see one two three four
Remember the other terminology that we used because theres more than one max we would call this a local max
Theres a maximum in this general location right in here but theres also another one over here so I got a local max here and a local max there local mins as well
Thats how some of that vocabulary works together
Again concepts of relating graphs and equations is together
Next topic is something called even and odd functions
Now this specifically is in the 38 homework thats due tonight
The homework for 38 and three nine
Thats one clever assignment
15 questions
15 questions thank you
Its due tonight by midnight
There are some problems like this that youll be working on
First read this disclaimer right here
Weve talked about even and odd degrees but this is about even and odd functions
Totally different terminology so we dont want to confuse them
The idea is if I have something called an even function its symmetric about the yaxis
When I look at this one right here if I fold my graph over on the yaxis thatll lay right on top of the other half of it
Thats called an even function
An odd function is if its symmetrical about the origin
For example on this guy right here if I could kind of break it off right here and rotate this part around 180 degrees it would lay on top of that one
In other words I can kind of spin this on the origin symmetrical about the origin and itll lay on top of itself at some point
Theres those two cases of an even and odd but theres also cases that neither is true
We end up having three different answers as possibilities to a prompt that asks if its even or odd or neither
How we test that is in the red box here
In both cases I take my function and I plug in negative x in the place of x
Then I see if I end up with what I started with and I started with f I put in a negative x for x but if I end up with the same thing it is an even function symmetrical about the yaxis
For this guy I do exactly the same thing but my result is that I get basically the opposite of the original function
So in other words all of the signs have changed from positive to negative or negative to positive
If you want to turn in your book to page 171 theres this example but were also going over it on the board but if you want to follow it in your book
Were going to start with this guy
In all cases says whenever I come to the x I put a parentheses
In other words Im going to put in a negative X in the place  Oops nothing there
This is the idea right here
When I see the x I just simply make parentheses and my negative x goes in there
Thats what you see happening right here
We just stuck that in
Now if I do a negative times a negative times a negative I end up with a
Negative
a negative x3
Notice how that has changed from this by putting that in
A negative times a negative here gives me the positive 7x there
Now I look at this and I ask myself Is there any way I can rewrite that to look like that
It turns out notice how the signs are just simply the opposite right here
I can rewrite this by taking that negative sign out to be like factoring a negative one
This was my original f so its the opposite of f or the negative f
Its an odd function its symmetrical about the origin
How does it look for these other functions
Again first step in the place of x I just put a parentheses and then I go and I stick in a negative x somewhere right here
If I multiply a negative times itself four times what do I end up with
Positive
That ones two times so how does that compare with what I started with here
Its the exact same
Its the exact same thing
Yes
so that one is an even function it reflects right over the yaxis
Then the last one that were looking at the answer is going to be neither
When I plug this in and I multiply it by itself three times its still a negative x3
Im not changing that plus two its right there
When I compare these two theres no way of factoring out a negative and getting back to this
I cant get back to this from that expression so thats neither
It doesnt have either symmetry about the yaxis or around the origin
Remember example four so that if you need to refer back to a model when you hit those questions on the homework assignment you can just walk through that process there
Right
Questions right now on that
Yeah
Yeah Bens here
So I dont have to  to do it with negative or positive
Right
Yes
Okay
Any other question
Thats it for 38
Were going to leave that just one key idea that we have to get in 39
In your journals if youd open thumbs up to 39
I want to go home
I know
All right if youre the hallway partner All right hallway partner
Im aware its you
Tell your window partner what a polynomial model really means
What are they asking for here
All right
If Ive got reallife data whats the model going to look like
Its in the form of an
Graph
Graph
Equation
Thats what I got
In other words were trying to find an equation that matches the data
This is all about finding an equation
The only skill were going to cover is example number one
This is only in the textbook if you want to pull it out
All right page 176 if youre going to look in your books
All right this is a similar situation as weve done with quadratics where youve been given some information about some points that are on the quadratic and how to come up with that quadratic equations
Only now were taking it to a cubic
For a cubic I might just have three factors
Now on cubic though if I ended up multiplying all of this out my leading variables should be x3
Now there might be some numbers here and a whole bunch of stuff after it but were looking for that x3 because its a cubic function
If you wanted to think of it as the fact that you actually have three factors because multiplying X times X times X is what would give x3
Generically youre starting with a function thats going to have three factors and so if I look here and find my Xintercepts I can drop those right in to that red format
To remember its an X minus K type format
X minus negative four negative four was the actual Yintercept
I wouldnt leave it like that I would write that as X plus four but
you can see that the red represents the standard way of starting
Now with these Xintercepts there are a lot of different cubics that could have those same X intercepts
For example I could have a cubic that does that and still goes through the exact same Xintercept
That means there has to be some sort of modifier as to whether or not its like this red one which is positive the blue one which is a negative reading coefficient so we have to find that Avalue
To find that Avalue we have to have some other point to put in
It may be a Yintercept or maybe its another point on the line
For example this point might just be four
Lets see is that negative 12
4 6 8 10 12 14 7 negative 14
It could be one where we have to look at a graph and go Oh you know what
Thats right all those crosshairs of the grid so I can know with some confidence
What do I do with that equation
I take my Y value and put it in here and I put my X values in the place of all of those and calculate it out
Now this particular example though theyve told us what the Yintercept is
When I make all those X is zero it makes my calculations pretty easy
I dont have any big numbers that I have to be working with
The whole idea here is I plug in another point a different point it cant be an X intercept its got to be some other point that I plugin for Y and for X solve for A and then rewrite my equation
Now when youre looking at any constructedresponse problems that have this kind of thing on the test pay close attention to the prompt
Does it tell you what kind of form to leave your answer in
If it doesnt tell you then leave it this way because that simple but if it says standard form you got to multiply that out and put it in standard form
If I have or lets say its actually this way I have four I will make that a negative one half like that half
If Im multiplying four things together how do I multiply four things together
In whatever order you want because multiplication can go in any order but pick two things and come up with your answer
Copy the next parts down pick two things
Come up with your answer multiply those last two things to get your answer
Now heres what we started class with
Remember I told you if youre given a graph and you have to come up with the equation or youre given the equation you got to come up with the graph this is your thought process to check to see if youre getting the right answer
Understanding this as your thought process when youre done either direction whether from graph to equation or equation to graph
Everybody has got a book you know thats on page 176 if you need to refer to that and heres the toolkit and heres our practice problems
Ill just get rid of the answers for right now
All right so this is in a journal page 104
Youve got until lets say the bell at 202 so you got to the bell at 202 to figure out the exact equations for these four to step four problems
Then well take a break for five minutes and then do the quiz
I will Im so sorry
All right
Ladies and gentlemen the answers to those first four are on the board
Thats it
I just want you to work on those first four and then you can work on the toolkit
If youve got questions
That was a joke
All right guys
Youve just got the two more minutes before the bell then we have a fiveminute break and then were going to start the quiz
All right guys we need to split the desks up
You guys will stay right where youre at but everybody here needs to move over to the wall
All right guys lets go
We got to get set up
If youre in this row just move your desk one tile over beyond that tile line right here
If youre here youll just move one tile over this way
You guys can stay where youre at and the rest of you just go all the way over to the
All the way
Ladies and gentlemen you can use your toolkit and get that green one that you used last week
You could use that one
Theres no calculator no textbook no journal
Then Byron you guys need to be all the way against the wall and you need to give Alex a little more space
Lets get that stuff put away
Phones need to be off and off of you so not in your pocket not in a jacket
In your backpack
In your backpack is fine and dandy
Let me just get rid of those
Dont forget to clean up your
If youve got a microphone on your desk if you would go ahead and turn the microphone off and then put the microphone on my desk
in here should we just leave it there
No we need to put it on my desk
Thanks
Youre welcome
Put that away
Okay
Yes
Because I dont think it was in there
Okay
Okay
Thank you Thea
Thank you
Youre welcome
Thank you
Thank you
Youre welcome
If you guys would scooch over a little bit further
Thank you so much
Just these two things
Everything else needs to go
Since you guys are not in alphabetical order if you would come pick up your scantron for me

It is 214 and you have 12 multiplechoice questions
It might not be a bad idea to put the time at the top of the paper that youre starting at 214 and then write your finish time and figure out how long did it take you to do the 12 multiple choice
Kind of tells you How am I going to do on Wednesday when I have 20 multiple choice
Do I need to pick up some skills and figure out how to move a little faster or am I okay
Yes
Are these all level two questions
Yes they are all level two type questions
Yes
Theres no level threes
No level threes of fours on this
What time is it
It is 214
Just because she says it doesnt mean he hears it
That was probably the most important lesson I learned in teaching
Is what
How to not take it personal when I said something three or four times and somebody says What time is it
Sometimes people are just so stupid
Like you
Yes
We all zone out every now and then
No biggie
Highly recommend that you show your work on this so that if you get it right you know how to do it
If you get it wrong you know what to look at and figure out what went wrong
Whether you do it right or do it wrong its good to show your work
If you would go ahead and put that version on the scantron so that we just get that out of the way and have that done
Bubble in the version
When youre done youve go time to go ahead and either work on the online homework so you can get out computers and phones and stuff like that once youve turned in your quiz or be working on the tool kits
Remember tool kits are due tomorrow
Im sorry
the rest of the time
Yes if you need the rest of the time
It turns out I think in about a halfhour everybody was done in the previous class so it actually work out fairly well
I was happy with that
