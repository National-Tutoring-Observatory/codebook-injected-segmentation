Spencer can you please read our learning target for today
I can write numbers with decimals in expanded form
All right
I ask you to also get out your whiteboard and whiteboard markers
I want you on your whiteboard to please write the number 342 in expanded
form
Take on another 30 seconds
Show your purple partner and with your purple partner I want you to hifive if you both agree and talk until you do agree
Go
Go
Okay
If I call your name if you could come up and stand right here and show your board
Show me first please
Stephanie
Quick
Why do you think think first dont talk
Why do you think I have these two at the front there right now
Rylan
Because they both did it
All right use my thumbs please
All right
I agree
They both did it right but they both did it differently
Kendall can you please explain your thinking to us
What I did was three
Im going to stop you
Dont start with what thats the question word
Start with I
You are the subject
I did was
I see
Kendall why did you
Because you said 342 so I
Your three is in what place
On hundreds place
Stephanie explain it
Where are our eyes right now
I did 300 plus 40 plus 2 because you said 342
300 plus 40 is 340 plus 2 is 342
But why did you split it apart like that
Why 300
Because if you take away 42 from 342
The value of the numbers
300 is the value
Stephanies was the most popular way only a couple of you thought this way but they both are correct
Thank you very much
Today we are going to be doing the exact same thing that most of you did correctly but were going to be doing it with decimals
The reason we started with the whole numbers I want to show you that you understand this already
You understand how to do this and decimals do not change the understanding
Can we please read our success criteria Sloane
I can write numbers with decimals in expanded form
Thats technically our target which I think we read already
Please read the success I know I understand
I know I understand this when I can rewrite the decimals in expanded form from all different ways
Some of the standard innovation  expressed in decimals and where it is practiced
Were going to be talking about the different ways we can use the expanded form
Open your Chromebooks right now and those who are nearpodcom
The web address is right here
Once you get in there you can put in our code for our lesson today
Its the same number that you use to get in its that number  so pull it out all your login information is in your planner
All right
Yes please
If your neighbor needs help please feel free to help them
Do you need any help
No
When you are on the correct page it should be red and it should say decimals in many forms
Its your number Lisa
Its not  Its the number
Its your tool so go look at it
What kind of Once you get to the Welcome to this session you are going to write your name
Just your regular name
Nothing fancy nothing silly just your regular name
Show me thumbs up if youre ready
Yes Stella
How come if you
I dont want to see anybody on any other screen other than the red one
Thank you very much boys and girls for your patience
Lets just have a could more of people
While we wait for these last couple of people why dont you just try to write one and thirteen hundredths
First just write that number on your whiteboards
One and thirteen hundredths
My friends who are still logging in keep logging in
One and thirteen hundredths
One and thirteen hundredths
Show me
Now with your purple partner I want you to see if you could write that in expanded form applying the knowledge of how to write a normal expanded form number in expanded form
Work with your shoulder or your partner
Zoe  if this thing stops moving lets just train off
Just press the power button
Good job
Now whats your answer
Sure
Thats why we put it in your
Thats where your  is supposed to be
I dont know what  Please put in your number
80 value something and there is a number
Thats fine
What did you type that
Because thats the log in
All right
Show me what youve got what you and your partner decided
Santiago will you stand up in front and share with the class what was your thinking
We have 1 plus plus 010 and plus 03
We did 1 plus 010 plus 03 and got 113 hundredths
Not too many people have what Santiago has
When youre looking at expanded form you are really thinking what is the value of this number and writing it with the value by itself
Now Lets try 23 and 0412
Just write that by itself on your whiteboard
23 and 0412
What were you saying again
23 and 0412
Show me
I only asked for you to write that number
Now with your partner First you need to
All right boys and girls Im going to stop you
I think you are all in
Are you here with the code and everything
No not yet keep working
Keep working
Show me
Boys and girls when you find a decimal its the exact same thing so same strategy same everything is synonymous
The original number was 23 and 0423
Most of the class did a great job of writing that
When we write an expanded form we look at the value of each number whats the value of the two
Its in the tenths place and theres two tenths so thats what
10 20
Class lets try that again
10 20
If Im writing the most basic expanded form thats the value
A lot of you are keeping that 23 together
Thats not expanded form
Expanded form is taking the value of each number and adding them together
Its taking this number and expanding it
Can everyone put their hands together like this
Show me expand your hands what does that look like
When our hand is bigger
Expanded forms of numbers is taking this and making it bigger
The purpose of that Ethan is it shows that you understand the value of each number what each number actually means
Whats the value of the three now
Three
Say it if you know
Three
Just because were in our decimal side doesnt change what we do
What place is this four in
Tenths
Tenths
The value is four tenths
What place is the one in
Hundredths
Im going to write one hundredths
When we got bigger in our value here we add zeros at the end
Now were getting smaller so were putting zeros between the decimal point and the number
What place value does the two have
Thousandths
I want to hear the whole class say this once
Thousandths
Then I have nothing in my tenths nothing in my hundredths and my two in my thousandths
Take a look at your number that you wrote which you should not have erased
If you wrote that great job
If you didnt we are still going to be working on that for our  lesson
I think we are still waiting maybe for one more person
Boys and girls I so so appreciate your patience
I appreciate it so much
In fact Im going to give you a green bean
This has taken about 20 minutes just to get people logged in
Santiago
Thanks a lot left in here
There should be and I dont know why  Now were going to head back and actually start our  lesson which is a little bit of review and a little bit of new
Are we in
Brynn were going to get started  when you join
Im going to write this code down for you
Youll just pop in wherever we are in our lesson
Whats going on up here
There we go
Now remember this was the only this is the second time Ive done Nearpod so there might be some technical things as we figure it out
All right how do we write decimals in different ways
Thats our purpose for today
Were going to have to say reviewing and continuing to work with our decimals written in different ways
Can you please read that first and remember you have it on your screen
You actually dont have to view it here you can view it right there on a screen in front of you
Ethan can you please read that first check
Weve already practiced some of these
Base 10 numerals means numbers regular numbers number names means word form
Talk with your purple partner what are the ways weve already learned before today to write decimals
Go
Go
Five four three two one
Andy what ways have we already learned to write decimals
What was the last one
Attaching the zeros to write at different points great
Today were going to do new learning which isnt a new  theres expanded form and then were also going to be Please read this one out
Decimal numbers to real word problems
Thats the essential most important piece is we dont just do decimals in math you use decimals all of the time whether you know it or not
I need you to make sure that you are being thoughtful in what you post
What do you already know about reading and writing decimals
Use pictures and words to share what you know
Im going to give you about 30 to 45 seconds to type or whatever anything that you know about decimals
Go
Go
Think about our learning so far
Whats that learning we did the first day when we wrote the exit slip
Think about where you might use them think about different ways to write them
A couple of great points on there
About 20 more seconds to share and people already shared then go ahead and read and yes I noticed some of you liking
Thats fine
If you agree go ahead and click the little part to show you agreed with a statement
All right
choose one persons statement thats different than yours that you found either interesting or that you forgot and that helped you remember and think what youre going to share with your partner
In just a moment youre going to share somebody elses statement and why you chose it to share with them
Youre looking at your screen right now
Were not adding anything more youre not to add anything more
Choose one persons statement that you find interesting that expanded your knowledge that affirmed what you knew and be ready to share with your partner
Share with your purple partner please
The person with the darkest shirts go first
What was something you learned and why
Go
Go
Five four three two and one
One thing I noticed Kendall and Sean that you guys already know a lot about decimals
I think these are all accurate and you already know a lot about decimals
Lets keep going
Where would someone need to know how to write Okay so this is applying it to the real world
I want you to think  Youre not touching your computers
Where in the real world would someone need to know how to read or write a decimal
I want you to think where in the real world with you to encounter decimals
Share with your pink partner share with your pink partner
Now go ahead and do your idea
Im not going to give a ton of time for the drawing
Im literally going to give one minute
Im putting it on my watch to hold myself accountable
Obviously theyre not going to be beautiful
Its hard to write with apps
You dont have to erase it you would have kept it for me
By the way friends if you click the T for text box that means you could type your answer
You dont have to draw it
You could do both
You could draw and type
Like if your drawing looks weird you could type a label so people know what it is
By the way my timer just went
All right so go ahead and submit what youve got
Its like whos drawing just popped up there
Its fine
You can share with us
What is it
Its a hospital where people can enter  pills substance that they provide
Definitely hospitals will use decimals when theyre taking measurements and different things like that
Money great
At the store Im seeing quite a couple of monies
Okay were not drawing anymore
I asked you to submit and thats it
We should have everybodys  A lot of different situations with money
Thats probably the most common way we use decimals
Friends who are talking while Im talking please stop
All right lets visit a place were going to learn how to use realworld decimals
The next slide youre going to see a picture of a gas station
I want you to think as you look at that gas station what are the different places you would see a decimal or encounter decimals at that gas station
Just think first
Remember our focus is looking for decimals
Yes you can zoom in and zoom out but the focus is decimals
Share with your pink partner where the different places that you might see decimals at a gas station
