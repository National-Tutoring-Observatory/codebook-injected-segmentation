Number five
It looks great
Okay
Tell me what youve done
Right
Its just the same issue as  by doing that
Sometimes that
Remember the whole idea is we want it to equal zero
Well thats a zero
Thats a six that will be zero and well
Cool
What does the table do to get that gauge
Yes
You plug in the 05
If you plug in zero all you get is the yintercept
Thats the yintercept
How are you guys doing
Do you have any questions
Were doing pretty good
All right
Do we need to put this back into the
No
I dont think its asked you to do that
Right
Yes
How are you going to find the vertex then
b2a
Way to go
Okay
Its called complete
Now you actually dont have to convert the form
Theres a way of finding all the data you need
Its a great exercise too
Its really not
What do we call the
Why is it called that
It gives you x
Right it can tell us what the xintercept is
Whats always true about an xintercept is
If Im multiplying something together and my answer has to be  what has to be true about at least one of the things Im multiplying
My answer is zero  how do I get zero
One of them has to be zero
If this  value has a zero and those are the two things Im multiplying
What would make that equal to zero
The whole thing
Hes right
Its probably three
What would make that
No
Its b2a
of symmetry
How do I find the middle of two numbers
like two
Perfect
Now youve got the xvalue of the
If you have the xvalue how do you find the one
There you go
Number four
All right so if you want to  its all multiplied out
Its all individual numbers theres no multiplication
Right
Theres no  If I asked you to multiply 2 x 3 x 4 how would you
multiply 2 x 3 x 4
Does it matter if I do that first and then multiply it by 10 or multiply those and then multiply that one
No
It still doesnt matter
You just got to make sure you multiply them all
Now what is the answer to this
Whats 2 x 3
Six
Times four
All right
Now what I dont know Trish is if what you were saying was do you have to multiply that times that and that times that
They already did that
You could multiply the two final  and then multiply
If I  all of them
Well that would be like to get my answer do I do 2 x 4 and get a
Yes
2 x 3 and get 6 6 x 8 and the answer is 48
Get your answer for that and then multiply it by the
Y is
Nomial is
so if weve got two terms and two terms those are each called
What shape does this graph
The shape is a parabol
Is it going to have a min or a max
Because
Because
Then how do you know its racing down into a negative
A value is negative
Coefficient times quadratic term is negative
When it says the highest point what is it asking for with regard to that
The vertex
How can I find the vertex of a standard form like that
I have zero idea
You could but looking at that I dont really like any of those numbers
You could
Its just going to be a little tricky with those kind of numbers
Three numbers are a quadratic form
The quadratic formula the first two and that is the very center
Whats the quadratic form
I add to get to that and I subtract to get to that
Hey guys this is the only email that I have and all it says here is that theres police activities but its affecting all these schools
How do you find the xintercepts is what youre saying or the x value of the vertex
The x value of the vertex
I think we did a good job
Everybody should probably do that because given the numbers I want to make sure everybody is on track
We know that the symmetry is negative five
Its 42
I have one going to be 4x squared plus 32x 148
It s like it s down here because if you got minus 30 whatever
Whats the equation
What equation are you getting
4x232x48n
Did you get the x value correct
I multiplied  and then I multiplied by
Ladies and gentlemen let s see if we can finish it up in the next few minutes five minutes
If we think about the  and  and then weve got  and this distance is
How high is the fence
I got  points
For that
Yes
Is the trajectory going to do that or is it going to do that
Thats
What value is that  and is that
Its x equals that
Can you plug it in into
Give it another try
Were distributing
All right coaches you should be getting that point where you checking answers wrapping up this activities in the next couple of minutes
Ladies and gentlemen so go ahead and close your student journal
You can go put it away and come back to your desks
All right books and journals put away
No you can use the cards
Well use them for the next not quite the next but the next after the next
Since this is the first time that youre in your teams lets do a little team building activity
What I have up here are chips with a question on one side and so the question side goes down and well do two rounds
Doing two rounds with kind of a limited number of chips might mean you get the same question again which means come up with a new and answer and so what well do is have person number one come up
Theyll grab a chip just take it back to your desk
Youll read it and then person number two will do the first answer then three four and back to number one
The person with the chip is the last one to actually answer it
When theyre done answering it they hand it to person number two person number two puts it back down here face down grabs another one and goes back and you repeat that process
The person with the chip just reads the question everybody else answers
They answer pass the chip and you take turns
Well do two rounds so each person will get up twice to grab a chip
Any questions
All right person number one
Its not moving
Actually I need SpiderMan
favorite music and
What are we talking music genre
Yes music genre
Probably
I can vie for that
Ice cream
I like ice cream because it tastes good
Whats your favorite
Hot because I can do
I just dont like to play
Whats your favorite horse
I have no idea
That sucks
All right Thomas you get it done
whats your favorite word
Go ahead and pick up this Id like you to do problems five and six first and factor it
Hello
Now that were alone
first
Yes Ive never got to factor it at all
Yes just factor it out first
Yes
Factor
Im not doing
Not me
It was like two oclock and I was
Right now its  lets see what  So I went back  and I started relistening to Living Tombstone
Whats so epic about it
Jumpscare horror doesnt affect me but its like psychological
Whats your favorite cartoon
Have you ever played Doki Doki
Doki Doki Literature
Its scary
Just watching a playthrough of it
Whats it called
Doki Doki
DOKI DOKI
That sounds super sketchy
Did you get 7075
Yes
the Y
the Y
All right ladies and gentlemen
As youll see some of the teams have already picked up the blue set of practice problems
On that blue set of practice problems I want you to start with problems five and six
Five and six
Start
Maybe Im wrong
No I did
I mightve done
All right so 15
We have 3 and 15 right
Yes
Shoot
Why am I wrong
So its 15  fraction
So 2 52 you get 2254 I get
All right
Ladies and gentlemen eyes of upfront please
talking to
I dont like this class
So as I mentioned about the test next week the level four question can draw Well actually probably even the level three given the fact were really focusing on linear and quadratics
One of those skills is remembering how to factor
A Lot of you were dong that as part of those other activities which is great but I wanted to make sure we started this worksheet since our time is limited
Hopefully its limited and we get to go at 224 right
Yes
So this is a quadratic
What form is this in
Standard
Standard
Standard
When we factor the standard form equation what do we call that form
Standard form
No this is standard so when we factor it I used to call it factor form but the big idea has a different name for it
Standard
Youre getting the right idea Chloe
Standard
Yes youve got it
Right
All right
Ill check that
Hold on
is so quiet
So if were in standard form and we factor it I used to call it factor form but what does it really tell us
Whats the thing that factor form tells us
The intercepts
That it intercepts
X intercepts so we want to call it
Intercept form
Intercept form
Ladies and gentlemen I see some people not working on five and six
So if you werent listening to me you dont know youre supposed to start with five and six
Were starting with this so that you get some practice refreshing your memory
How do you factor it when A is one
How do you factor it when A is not one
Now I taught my classes factoring by grouping for this
That may be what you have
You might want to be referring to your math two toolkit I believe it would be in essential outcome too that you would find a toolkit on how you factored when the A value is something other than one
So I want you to start with five and six
When you feel confident about those two then move on to problem number one two three and four
I havent factored
Completing this
Yes but were not going to complete the square of it
I really like what you did
Yes
You did factor by grouping basically although thered be a plus in between there
Thats the only thing
that would take longer to do
Okay
Well well compromise
and then you have X  5
Do one we really need
Okay
Look at this one
This is five and six
multiplies to this as this
The hell
Like the quadratic formula
No
No
We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus
Weve got the negative  but this is a positive
So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five
So I did positive two and negative five and then
Does that make sense
Yes
Because its symmetrical so I have to add that much and subtract that much to find the point on either side of that
So Ive got that but then I add the same amount subtract  that gives you my symmetry
Thats
I have a negative
Right
So that whole thing tells me
So that
I have my vertex right here
I got  the X values and then I plug that into my function
This is not only the equation of the line of symmetry its also the X value
If I know X how do I find Y
Point it towards the X
You plug it in
This is my function notation
I plug that in the equation
Got it
Okay
Im starting to figure out how you like get it
Wheres the X times that and then you square it on the outside
Thats what Im talking about
Yes we can find them
Ill tell you if I  or you can just plug it off
just going to point it in there
Did you let them out
We all call it access
Okay
Well the good news is you dont have to
No I need to
Were staying  math today
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Hold on
Hold on
All right
Do you know why you did that
So this is more the kind of strategy for this one
Negative one over 12
Let me figure out a couple of sample problems and Ill put them up
So 15 is the X value
Thats where
So we plug that in  negative B
Oh you have to plug in 22 five times
225 plus or minus  negative 145
Thats negative
No thats 235
Its going to be 1225 negative 1225
Yes
Write that there and then we dont have to
Since that is 15 away from here
We did it
For sure
I hit the car button but nothing happened
Well the Y intercept is
Nothing happened
So negative 1225
Yes
We did it
We did
How are you supposed to do that
Next one
Thats what I was hoping to do
Now were going to do the
but I could check just to see if its
Yes negative two and five are there
And then that would be negative
No itd be 124
Yes but then you square it then itd be positive
So you get 025 or 14
We keep it in fraction
All right
Ladies and gentlemen we get to stay together until three
Oh no
Im supposed to know
Because
Because
Can we just like  homework
Well heres my plan
Do we have time to work
I do want you to know how to factor these two things
So if you could at least give me as best attention as you can at this time of day for going through these two examples
Then lets just say I want you to go back and do five and six on that page and one more so youll do half of the problems that are on that blue and then you can take the rest of the time to work on toolkit and homework and that sort of thing and get those questions answered
Does that sound reasonable
Is that okay
Can I
Anyone
Well I definitely want to go over this you may want to take notes with this
No way
You may already have this stuff in your toolkit and you just need the refresher
So again Im in standard form
I want Taco Bell
and the instructions are to factor
So if my Avalue is one theres one strategy and if my Avalue is something other than one Ive got a different strategy
So lets start with this one
My Avalue is one whats my B value
Three
Three
Three so thats the coefficient of the linear term
This is the coefficient of the quadratic term
I do want you to know the vocabulary
Ten is called a
Yintercept
It is the yintercept
It is my Cvalue but in terms of like this is a quadratic term this is a linear term this is a Yes its a constant
Yes
Its always going to be 10
It doesnt change
The X that changes things but this guy doesnt change
Its called the constant
What Im hoping is somewhere in your memory is this phrase factors of C What is C in this case
Ten
Ten
What are the factors of 10
One
Ten
Were being systematic
One two
Its one and
Five
Or two and
Five
Five
Or three
No
Or four
Or five
Two
Fives already in my list so I know I can stop
Now having done that notice Im just being very systematic about it
Now I have a second set
Whats different about that set
There has to be a multiple
My second set of factors of C
It has that
Okay
I havent gotten to that part yet
All right
Ill have one set of factors and then I change the signs of everything
I might have a negative and a positive and then I change it to positive and negative but Ill have two sets to be complete
All right
So factors of C and then the next part that adds to B
So my Bvalue is
Three
Three
Three does one of those combination add to three
Yes
Yes
Which one
Five
Maybe five and two
Two and
Five and negative two
Five and negative two
But what would that have to mean
Do I have any factors of C that add up to B
No
No
What does that mean I have to use
Quadratic formula
The quadratic formula
That means Ive got to use this to find my X intercepts
All right
Now what would I just simply have to change in this so that I do have a factor
If I change this guy to a negative so factors of negative 10
Lets see if theres any of those that add up to three
Negative one and 10
Negative two and five three four and five is not in there
My opposite set one and negative ten two and negative five
Does one of those add up to three
Negative two and five
Okay
In this case once I found those Ive actually found my two factors
Whats always true about Xintercepts my two ordered pairs whats always true about an Xintercept
The Y is zero
Y is zero
So this has to be zero here and Im multiplying two things together and my answer is zero what does one of them have to be
Zero
Zero
One of those has to be a zero
So the work I show is to say X minus two oops
I dont want it in parentheses
sorry
Either X minus two equals zero or X plus five equals zero
So add two to both sides subtract five and those are my two Xintercepts
Think about this way if I put it on here Ive got a positive two and a one two three four five did I do it wrong
Yes minus five
Right
Yes
Minus five and two
So theres my Xintercepts
Whats the line of symmetry going to be then
How do I find the line of symmetry
You add those two together
Right because the line of symmetry has to be right in the middle and thats really why I graphed it
Come on Chandler
Because when I look at that I get an idea Oh well my line of symmetry does have to be in the middle
how do I find the middle of anything
Add them up divide by two so negative three halves
Right here theres my line of symmetry
The equation for that line is what I just found
My vertex has to be on that thats also the Xvalue of my vertex
If I know X how do I find Y
Plug it into either one of those
Lets do this one because it looks like the math might be easier
Y is going to be negative 15 minus two negative 15 plus five
negative 10 you add that to one
That cant be right
What did I do wrong
Negative three halves oh this would be
I cant because that doesnt make any sense
Its negative its not negative B
Yes but the whole fraction is
If its negative
All right just finish that work for tomorrow
That was like epic though
I was going to
