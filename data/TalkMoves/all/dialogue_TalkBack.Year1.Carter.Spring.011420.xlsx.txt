I am going to dictate a fraction and you need to write three fractions that are equivalent to the fraction I give you
You have a strategy that might help somebody to do this when they are not sure
Talk at your teams
Talk at your teams
If you have an idea for the strategy share that out
Ill deal with your team
What would be an efficient way to generate those fractions Brody G
Using the multiplication maam
Okay so whats the saying that we have for that
Whatever youre do to the top you do to the bottom
Yes or vice versa  whether its the bottom first top first whichever all right
Here we go
Here we go
The first fraction is one third and that left three equivalent fractions on your slate here
You dont need to write down the whole process just put the fractions
Somebody have an extra slate
It looks like TJ didnt get his slate back
Does anybody have an extra slate running around in their desk
Some of my friends may have put them in their desks from our club yesterday
No maybe somebody might have taken them home
I dont know
Probably not
Flash
Remember youre generating three okay
Im going to have you share with your face partner
Check each others work
Flash
Just three each time thank you
Youre going to share with your face partner
If you shared first last time share second this time please
Ready
Go
Flash
Thank you this time share with your face partner
The other  to go through
Rate how well you can find equivalent fractions using our multiplication rule thank you
Whats the point of having an equivalent fraction
Think back to our learning intention that weve been working with
Why do we want equivalent fractions
What were we doing last week with them
Im trying to find that
What were we doing
Why do we need an equivalent fraction
Theres a hint up on the slide
Look to your shoulder partner
Partner I bHuntereve goes first
Ready
Go
What is one use for equivalent fractions Samantha
One use for equivalent fractions in the real world you could use them to do
You could  them
You would need some equivalent fractions if youre trying to add onefourth or  into one half of the  used so that way you know how much  only total
That way you can use the multiplication rule or the common denominators to look through that when you want to figure out how much total
I love the way people are feedbacking thank you
Thanks for bringing the real world to it
I like that too
What would be another use thats not having to do with adding and subtracting
River did you have an idea of another use that wasnt adding and subtracting
When you find a different answer to something else and you dont want to use the same answer like everybody else is using you could do that
Why would we want to do that
Im just curious
I like that you came up with something good job but why would you want to do that
It doesnt answer  know it  and you want to try something different
Okay
Youve come up with different equivalent fractions
Who had a different way thank you River that wasnt adding and subtracting
Anybody have a different idea
Think for a minute
What would be another use of having equivalent fractions
ALexis
fraction Well not really the fraction but two of the numbers the numerator and the denominator
You could  into half instead of
More comprehensible easy to use good point
Hunter
I said if you had to add to two eighths
No other than adding and subtracting buddy
Thats what I was saying not using adding and subtracting
Thank you for trying
Ainsley
You could use equivalent fractions to find common denominators
Im not sure how that works
Youre saying generate a list of fractions
What are you saying
The equivalent fraction you could find the common denominator with them
Yes like we did in the journal pages
Where we brainstormed a list of equivalent fractions and then we found two that were the same denominators so we could work with them
Last idea
Victoria
Its similar to ALexiss in a way
Lets say you have to build something and its a project similar when youve got two numbers that you cant visualize
Sometimes doing a common denominator helps you really visualize how much you might need to find ones that
You cant necessarily picture what 50 thousandths looks like so you put it in lowest terms it might actually be more meaningful and do that for other fractions
Yes
I was thinking comparing fraction
When they say Put these fractions in order one third two fifths ninetenths
Sometimes its hard to know
If you put them in common denominators youd be able to compare the fractions youd know because theyd all have the same denominator and you just look up a numerator to decide
There are some ideas for relevance
Lets just quickly review
Todays learning intention is the one from yesterday
Read it with me please
How to use factors and multiples to find common denominators to add and subtract fractions
We were using the words factors and multiples yesterday
Think about the success criteria and then well review that vocabulary
Here we go
Here we go
I will know I am successful when I can apply a strategy to identify common denominators and explain how different strategies work
Are you going to rely on only one way to do this
No
No
No
Weve learned one way
Whats another way you could do that using fraction circles
How could you use fraction circles to find a common denominator
Youre going to work with your shoulder partner see if you can use fractions to
All right youre going to show your partners across from you the equivalent things you came up with and explain that process
The team closest to the west wall will explain first
Ready
Go
All right back to me please
All right back to me please
Would this be a very efficient way to come up with equivalent fractions
No
It definitely helps you see it for sure right
Yes
Lets look at the slide to refresh your mind about factors and factor pairs
We were thinking about what are factors so you can explain it
Stop worrying about your manipulatives
Focus on the slide
What are factors
You re going to talk with your face partner
Partner A goes first
Ready
Go
Thank you
What is a factor
Factor pairs are like different numbers that go into a specific number like 36 in that case so that two numbers that make that a 36
Do you see people not sure
Do you people agreeing
Some people that want to add to it
Can you pick somebody that wants to add to it
I agree with your team
What Id like to add on I also think its more than one number trying to make up another number like one certain number because 2x18 makes up 36 and thats their certain number and its as many numbers that makes up another number
Reading about it its numbers that are always going to make up another one
Clay
I dont really know if I agree with Addison because it is two numbers making up another number
A factor is the two numbers getting multiplied together to get your product
When you multiply the two numbers together thats a factor pair like five and four is a factor pair of 20
Five would be a factor and four would be a factor of 20
What was different about Brody s explanation compared to some of our explanations
Think about how were they different
Tatum how was Brodys explanation different
Because he gave detail and really explained the definition of factor pair
Using
Using vocabulary
Using the vocabulary
Like I heard him say the word You multiply
or I heard him talk about product
I heard him talk about the word factors
He gave an example that labeled that and explained it
I think that made it more comprehensible because Ive heard people saying its numbers that make up a number
What does that mean
Okay
Thank you Brody for bringing that clearly to us
Thank you everybody for participating
Think about our game Buzz that we played before we started now
What does the game Buzz have to do with this
Which vocabulary word were you practicing in a way when you were playing Buzz
Thumbs up if you have an idea
Go ahead pocket your team
Start with person three sharing their thinking first
Ready
Go
Back to me
What is the vocabulary word that were practicing fo the game Buzz
Janessa
Here s a hint starts with an M The slide is up that might help you
Multiply
Multiples
Everybody say that
Multiples
How is playing Buzz practicing multiples
How s that game practicing that Miguel
It s practicing that because the Buzz number pretend its like three and you re saying One two three and then Four five six
For three and six youre saying Buzz
because those are the multiples of three
Nice thank you
All right nice review
Lets go to the actual lesson
I feel like we re going to do really well because of your review
I know you worked harder here
Yesterday I think we did 12 and 20 didn t we
Yes
Now we have 29
Write down what are the factors of 29
The factors of 29
Flash
Yes
Yes
Why could I be so quick
Why do I expect you to just generate that so rapidly Samantha
Because 29 is a prime number so it s only divisible by one and itself
Yes
Yes
Theres no other number factors for it
Its not an even number
You know that three isnt going to go into it
You know four isn t
You should know boom
I like your word prime
Thank you
Now I want you to come up with some multiples for 29
Come up with three multiples of 29
Ready
Go
Flash
Thank you
Id like you to talk at your teams about your multiples and your strategy for finding the multiples
Start with Person four sharing
Ready
Go
Let s hear a strategy you used
Team B what was the strategy you used to generate those
Well I just kept adding 29 to the next number
People are agreeing excellent
All right lets move on here
Good review here
Can you see this through the organ
We have two thirds plus five ninths
What do you notice about that problem Fransisco
That they are not equivalent
Well theyre not equivalent but
Theyre not equivalent
Do you have to only add equivalent fractions
No
No
No
Theyre not equivalent is true but thats not what Im not wanting you to pay attention to
Youre right theyre not equivalent
What do you notice about these two fractions Gabrielle
That they both have unlike denominators
All right because thats why we keep finding equivalent fractions so we can rename them all right
I want you to list several equivalent fractions for each addin
On your slate list several equivalent fractions for two thirds and several equivalent fractions for five ninths
If you find that you have an equivalent fraction that has the same denominator for both then youll know youre ready to stand up
Thats how you know youve generated or not
All right I see some people not standing so Im going to have you have a conversation at your team about the equivalent fractions that youve generated
Talk at your teams
Talk at your teams
The person thats standing should talk to the team struggling with
What fractions do you see that have the same denominator
What are the two fractions Asher
Six ninths and five ninths
Thank you
What do you notice about the starting denominators
What do you notice about the starting denominators three and nine and the common denominator nine
What do you notice about them
Hunter
So what I noticed about them is theyre equivalent because three times three will become nine
Okay
People are agreeing with your statement
You want to add on to it Melody
Yes
Its similar
I agree with yours and I also want to add on that three can go into nine so you dont have to find another multiple
Its like that
One of the numbers can go into the other
You wouldnt have to multiply five ninths by anything because you can just do the twothirds multiply that by three then itll give you Both the denominators would be nine
Thank you
Thats exactly right once you see that its the same denominator youre done
You dont need to keep generating
Some of you figured that out immediately
Some of you still kept making a list
Youre just looking until you find one that has the common denominator
Once you find that common one then you can go ahead and work with it
Five ninths plus sixth ninths is that what the two fractions were
Then you add them together
Could we use multiplication rule to find the equivalent fraction
Lets see if theres a slide for that
No its not on here
Could we use the multiplication rule
Yes
Yes
Yes
That same idea to generate them
I think thats what a lot us used
Great
Remember you have to have common denominators so you can add and subtract them
Lets try another one
Heres two thirds plus one fifths
Make a list of equivalent fractions for each addin
When you start to see that they have the same denominator then stand up
You need to make sure your teams talk about why you stopped and what you could do with your problem next after youve found that
All right how would this be help you be able to solve the equation or the addition problems Diana
By  the subject on that easier to  pieces
So
I agree with that because you cant really add fractions that have the denominator  its tricky
Theres another way were going to talk about it real quick  because some people are just going to come and join me at the table needs some help
Read this with me
Quick common denominator or QCD
Yes you see where they get that name to see  common denominator
So quick common denominator for threesevenths and seveneighths
In order to do that you just multiply the two denominators together because then you know that the product theyre both to go into it
What would seven times eight be
Fraction to be  people telling me 56 and wont go away nice job
What is the common denominator of onefourth and twothirds
Pass it to me
Great
I see people telling me its  12
What is the quick common denominator for onetenth and threefifths
Gosh
Good just multiplying those two denominators you do that quick common denominator
Now think about this
Why would this strategy work
Explain in terms of factors and multiples
Just because you know that common denominator you have to know what to do with it
Asher why would this work instead of the factors and multiple
Talk with your shoulder partner about your idea
Make sure youre explaining in terms of factors and multiples
Ready go
Then I would multiply the denominator by three
What would I  so what well multiply the numerator by
Then we have there two fractions
Why does this strategy work
factors and multiples
This strategy works because if you multiply them both together you know that they both go into 50 so you dont have to keep multiplying them
You dont have to keep
Use the word factors and multiples you know that theyre both
You know that theyre both factors of 50
There you go
You dont have to keep finding the multiples of You dont have to use multiplication to get all the way to 50
What do you guys think
Now are you done once you know that the common denominator is 50
No
No
No
You know the new denominator what do you have to do to find the numerator
Show me a
How are you going to know what to multiply it by
Lets talk about the one thats onefourth and twothirds because thats a nice small number
What did I multiply 4 by to get the product of 12
Really like the way people are showing me
I multiplied the denominator by three
What do I multiply the numerator by
Three
Why did I multiply the denominator three by to get the product of 12
What do I need to do to the numerator
Multiply by
Four
Four
I get what to do with this I need more practice fabulous
I am going to have you use sage and scribe
You are going to be on page 157 could you please turn to that and  Liza I want you want you to be on 156
Were going to skip the parts at the top where we summarize I feel weve summarized all through the lesson
Go to the middle part  read these directions together
Used any of these strategies on common denominators rewrite each fraction using their common denominators then solve
Look at the first example
Were on 1a
See how we have twoninth and fivesixth
They found the common denominator of 18 so did they use the quick common denominator method
No
No
They probably generated some fractions
Some of you that know your math cats can probably find that common denominator because you know your factors of your numbers or you know your multiples of your numbers
They came up with a common denominator of 18
How did they turn twoninths into foureighteens
Talk with your shoulder partner
How did they know that twoninths is equivalent to twoeighteens
How did they know that twoninths was equivalent to foureighteens
Micha
You multiplied it by two
Multiply both the numerator and denominator by two
Yes
Nicely done
I get what to do on this page I dont get it
Youre saging and scribing so are both people writing
No
One person writes while the others  then you switch roles
Are you going to have every problem solved out on that page
No
When you and your partner are done with 156 you can check in with each other
How are you feeling
I feeling like I know what Im doing Oh I could use some more help
Youre both still Feelingthe same
Then you decide do you want to use the sage and scribe or do you want to use the work and check
If one persons not Feelingcomfortable should you do work and check
No
Youd want to keep saging and scribing to get that comfortable feeling
Why shouldnt that What should you do on these two pages
Theres
If all people need help then youd want to come to the table
Ready go
All right back to me please
All right back to me please
Thank you
Lets go back to our learning intensive
I will use factors and multiples
Find the common denominators to tell and describe fractions
I will know I am successful when I can I find the strategy to identify common denominators and the same time different strategies work
Did you meet this and how well did you meet it
For your column work you feel like having your math journal at home as a resource is helpful to you thats fine but make sure you bring it back
Your parents did not sit through this lesson they arent going to know what you are practicing
Do your parents have another idea possibly of a strategy
Yes
Is it okay to listen to another strategy
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
So dont tell your parents Look thats not how
That always sets off a grouchy tone to a homework help
Maybe hearing it a different way will help you understand it
So be open to their ideas
Let s make sure we know what the homework is
You get a copy put your name on it
When you get a copy of the homework put your name on it make your
Make you  following directions  follow directions
Thank you
Lets all read number one directions here we go
For each share of fractions in the table find the common denominator then rewrite the two fractions as equivalent fractions with a common denominator write greater than or less than in the same  to create a true number of
Do you see the table
Do you see all of those steps there for you
Questions about what you fill in each of those different sections of the table
I like that youre cleaning up but I prefer you could you to wait until we go over this homework please
Thank you
Lets look at their reminders for us
Remember the three strategies you have learnt list equivalent fractions check to see if one denominator is a multiple of the other denominator or multiply denominators to get quick common denominators
Those are the ones we practiced
Questions on number one
Lets look at the next set of directions
Use the tables to help you rewrite the problems with common denominators then solve
Questions about that
If this top part takes more than lets say 15 minutes then you dont have to do the practice down at the bottom
So if its like a normal thing for you to just whip this baby out in like five minutes go ahead and do the practice at the bottom
Does that make sense
I dont want this dominating your life should just be practice shouldnt be I have to relearn this whole thing
Like I said before if you want to take your math journal home as your resource feel free but just make sure you bring it back
Thank you for your hard work before you join up on the
