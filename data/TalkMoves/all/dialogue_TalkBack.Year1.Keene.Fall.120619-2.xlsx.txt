All right friends
You wanted to scoot two pages into your math notebooks
I want you with your shoulder partner to take about two minutes to just back and forth read through the Get Started problemsolving
Ready
Go
You have about 45 more seconds to read through
If youre done
keep recording
This is about the voices
It is not about your pictures anyways
Five four three two and one
Boys and girls we have gone through story problems many times
What is the first strategy that you need to do when you see a story problem
Talk to your shoulder partner
Five four three two and one
Tina whats the first thing that we need to do
We have to make a comment on
Great
Annotating it
What does annotating actually mean
Telisa
Annotating means write about the areas like what to do and like underline certain words in a sentence
What certain words are we supposed to underline
I agree with everything Ximena said I just want to get even more specific
What are some of the certain words that we need to underline
Luke
Youre getting almost too specific
In general what do we need to make sure that we underline
What type of clues
Clues that tell us which operation to use yes
What other types of clues
Oh my gosh theres an active listening problem for the first group thats two
Im telling you that they might
Theres 100s and 50s in there somewhere
Catch you doing the right thing
Clues that tell about the operation
What else
Ill take volunteers please
Avery
numbers important numbers
Any important numbers
Think about Mike
Any important
Anything that tells me Thats kind of like what Luke said that clues that tell me what operation Im going to use
Greyson
You could underline things that are really really important
Verbs is one thing I was looking for
The things that tell you what to do quickly
The things that tell you what to do
Do you need to explain your thinking
Do you need to Verbs often tell us what operation to use as well
Take about 45 seconds independently to annotate this problem on page 101
I think were fine until we start
So we will be finishing
20 more seconds
No were just annotating and you sir just underlined
You need to annotate
Annotating is not just underlining
Look at your problem if you just underlined you did not do the right thing
Remember we write maybe what operation we think we should use
We write what things mean
Maybe we draw arrows to connect
Pizza roll 51 year milk is splashing milk
Today is our experiment day
Our experiment is failing
That happens
Talk with your shoulder partner
I want the person with the shortest hair to go first explain what you annotated and why
Others partner youre either going to agree or maybe youre going to say things that youve also annotated or you might even tell your partner something like How is that important
Im not sure that needs to be underlined
Because some people will get annotation crazy and underline everything
Go
All right waterfall
Hayden come on down
Annotate tell us why
Just do one thing or
Everything
Everything should be annotated but you need to be talking to us
Thats why I gave you the mike
Hold the mike up closer to mouth
I did
What you said was fine
Just have confidence in yourself
Youre just telling us why you thought it was important
Thats all
So you know youre going to divide
So then should you annotate something over that
Yes
Yes
Go
Thats all I did
Anybody have anything they would like to add to any No
Jessie
Come on
Four  and five sandwiches and four
Yes
Yes four
what theyre splitting five sandwiches
Because thats what theyre sharing
Anybody have anything else
Carrie
I like what Jessie did because when we make our number sentence thinking back to the order of division knowing what it is youre splitting is so important to put that number sentence in the right order
So  actually gave me this idea
I did the question because thats how you know what youre going to be dividing and also so you know what youre actually dividing
That was to start off
Now I want you to write your number mile
What number mile would we have
