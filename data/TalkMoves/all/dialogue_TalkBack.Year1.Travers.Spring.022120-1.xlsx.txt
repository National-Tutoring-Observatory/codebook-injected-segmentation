All right fifthgrader
Im excited to be in here for some math today
Our lesson builds off of the lesson youve had over the last couple of days about using read these words with me powers
Powers of 10
I want you to really do some thinking back to the last couple of days
Today were going to be converting measurements in the metric system using what
Powers of 10
Powers of 10
Okay
Thats what our lesson is all about today
Ladies would you please read the learning goal for us
Ready
Go
Go
I will
I will multiply and divide by powers of 10  in metric unit
Thats a lot of information isnt it
The parts that are underlined thats whats really important in todays lesson
Were going to be multiplying and dividing by powers of 10
We did that the last couple of days
Exponent Ball was the game you practiced that yesterday
Were adding one more step to the multiplying and dividing by powers of 10 today
Were going to be converting measurements in metric units
Gentlemen we are going to read the success criteria today
The success criteria has three steps
When youre working on these problems today youre going to say Okay I have three steps I need to do in each of these problems
Lets read the first one that starts with the word break
Boys ready
Go
Go
Break the problem in two parts
Break the problem in two parts
Determine how the units are related
Determine how the units are related
Name the rule using exponential notation
Name the rule using exponential notation
That last part means when you write down what the rule is instead of saying multiply by 100 youre going to say what is the power of 10 in X Exponential notation means what power of 10
100 is what power
10 to the
X2
Instead of saying the rule was multiplied by 100 youre going to say the rule was multiply by 102
This is all things you can do its building off what weve learned over the last few days
All right
Here we go
This is our mental math
What Id like for you to do is think through this question
What rule or pattern can you use when you multiply or divide a whole number or decimals by power of 10
For example and this was hard for me to write because I didnt know how to do powers of 10 on the Google slides
The question is what if you had something like this
30 7 what is that
And
310
310
Divided by 102
Power of 2
Thinking about what youve done the last couple of days what is the rule that you can remember to use for problems like that
Or what if it was something like this
Times 102
You have a whiteboard in front of you
You have a word bank on the front whiteboard
The word bank says you might use words like backward forward smaller larger decimal shift which is another word for move
Right left
You might use some of these words
These words are here to help you
You can solve those if that helps you
What I want you to do is write down what rule or pattern do we use when were multiplying and dividing by powers of 10
You have a minute or two to do some writing and thinking
Use this word bank
This is were doing all everyone should be writing
What rule or pattern can you use when you multiply or divide whole numbers or decimals by the power of 10
Remember exponent ball
Youre right but how do you know far to move it
How do you know far to move the decimal
How do you move the decimal
How do you know how far to move the decimal
I just wanted to remove the point
Okay
Right now this question is going to make you do some thinking why does that rule work
Why does that rule work
Those of you that are finishing your explanation I want you to start thinking about the next question why does that rule work
Will it always work
Okay
You have 30 more seconds
You will be sharing something from your whiteboard with your table mates
All right
I am seeing some amazing math thinking
What Id like for you to do now is to find a place to stop and Id like you to please stand up
Okay
Ladies and gentlemen how we will be sharing our thinking is with the structure thats called roundrobin
Any time we say something that that is round that means youre going around at your table group and anytime we say robin that means youre talking
Were going to do whats called the single roundrobin where you go round your table group one time
When you were done when all four people are done sharing I want you to sit down
Thats my signal that youre done everyone has shared
Now I want you to keep your marker out in  Heres why
Someone on your team might say something that makes you go Oh yes If they do jot it down add it to your thinking
Or if someone explains it in a different way and you think Oh that makes more sense to me
Jot it down on your whiteboard
Everyone should be standing up nice and tall
Would you please wave at me if you are teammate number four
Teammate number four youre going first
Were going to do a reverse roundrobin
Teammate four teammate three teammate two and then teammate one
You need to share something all of whats on your whiteboard and then your team can comment
I agree
Oh I think you got most of it right
Youre all standing
Fletcher youre all standing
Can you see the easel
I want to remind you that there are some excellent phrases up here when youre commenting with your partners
Like Id like to add on my thinking is similar except my thinking is different Id like to add on
You have a lot of ways you can comment on your teammates thinking
Our goal is four minutes
I want you to try to give each person about one minute
Ill be watching the clock
Ill give you some reminders
Wave at me if your teammate four
Youre speaking first
Ready go
If you dont have a four do a three
Can you all hear him
No
No so start again because youre speaking to your whole group
Speak up
When you multiply you make the number bigger so you attach the zeros behind the number you started with and then
For division
Yes when you divide you make the number smaller
You move the decimal in front of the number you started with
Somebodys comment
Look over here on the board
What could we respond
I think you got most of it right and I would agree with  My thinking is similar because
How far do you move the decimal to the right
How do you know how far or where to move the decimal
How do you know
All right ladies and gentlemen thank you for your amazing participation
I saw lots of groups where kids were agreeing
I saw a couple of places where kids are adding on to their thinking
Would you please stand up and bring your whiteboard and marker to the carpet
Do not erase it yet
Would you please stand up and bring your whiteboard and marker to the carpet
Aubrey would you head up to the desk please
Right now you should be at the carpet and you should have your whiteboard
You should be ready to do some thinking
Ive asked Aubrey to come explain come up and show hers and you still have your marker so you can add on to yours while youre here
To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times as the exponent says
This occurs the same when you multiply instead of left you shift the decimal to the right
I showed this by showing the problems and turning the decimal moving to the left and to the right and then showing the answer
Aubrey right now you are the Mrs Travers
I would like you to call on some classmates to respond from our math talk
Anna
Thanks for noticing that
Jon
I like how you use the vocabulary  and you are very clear what you were saying and how you do it  and how it works
Faith
I liked how you
Did Aubreys response explain the rule
Aubrey would you read it to us one more time and I want everyone to be thinking does it accurately explain the rule
To divide the rule is that you have to shift the decimal to the left as many times the exponent says
This occurs the same when you multiply but instead of left you shift the decimal to the right
Now Im going to really challenge you
Aubrey Im going to have you leave yours up
Everybody else please erase
Heres the next question
Why does this rule work
Why does this rule work
You can look at Aubreys and I want you to be thinking on your whiteboard now Why or how does this rule work
Would it help to have some talk time
Yes it works
I know
We did some great mouth thinking
Are you thinking Aubrey
Why does this rule work
Doing some thinking when you divide and you move the decimal to the left it makes the quotient smaller
Why
When we multiply and we shift the decimal to the right our product becomes bigger
Why
What is the answer to the quotient
Quotient is division product is multiplication
I love how youre using math vocabulary
The answer to a division problem is called a quotient
The answer to a multiplication problem is called a product
Ms James you have an amazing class
I know
I love them
Look how everyone is thinking and even if theyre not writing I can tell that theyre thinking
Why does that rule work
Wherever youre sitting would you please turn so that you are in a team of two or three
Me to me
Me to me
We actually already have
If you already have a partner that you know who you work with at the carpet that is even better
Okay if you have the shorter hair Id like you to speak first
What is your new understanding about this rule and why or how the rule works
Go
Go
Aubrey thank you for being so brave and so willing to share your thinking with our class
We really appreciate it
Would you please close your conversation in three two one zero
Anyone willing to start our conversation about why or how the rule works
Jon thank you
This rule works because when multiplying youre moving the decimal point to the right making your number bigger
Making the product bigger
Yes and why does it work shifting the decimal to the left for division
It makes it smaller
Good
Riley
when you are multiplying  and when youre moving the decimal to the right it makes the whole number larger
Exactly
Smart thinking friends
My friends we are going to do a couple of mental math problems on our whiteboard while were here
I know you have done some amazing thinking on your whiteboard and I want to value your work
You may erase it
I know
Think about all the amazing thinking youve already done so far
Ms James this is where I will need to just be on this actual mental math for today
How do you get to it usually
All right my friends here we go
These are what we just talked about
Ready
Were going to move pretty quickly now
We have 500102
Were just going to write it
Write your quotient
Think about where you will be moving the decimal point
Will it shift to the left or the right
Left
How many places will the decimal shift
Say it
Say it
Two
You got it
Please check your own whiteboard right now
Is this your new quotient
Yes
Were checking our own whiteboards right now
Heres your next problem
31102
Think to yourself
Will my decimal
be moving to the right or the left which way friends
Right
Right
Right
How many place values
Two
Please check your board right now the answer is 310
Your new product
15103
Check your own board please
Answer is 15000
Well just do a couple more to get our brains warmed up and ready for today
373 102
I wonder if weve already seen this problem today
Thats right got it
373102
May I show you a little strategy
Ms James probably shows you amazing strategies too
My friends are we going to be moving the decimal
Are we shifting it to the left or to the right
Left
To the left
Im just gonna write that down because division means shift to the left were making our quotient smaller
How many places do I shift the decimal
Say it
Say it
Two
Have you tried the hops
This helps me one two
Thats where I know that I needed to shift it two places
Have you guys used the hops before
It helps me so much
What is our new answer
Lets read it together
Ready
Go
Go
373
You guys are amazing
Im going to give you two this time
Ready
One and two
I like using the hops
Its helpful to me
Hold up your hand if you need a little more time
Lets check
Please check the board
Your first product is 80800 and your quotient is 110
Heres a challenge
Look at all these smart math thinkers Ms James
If I could see the inside of their brain we would see synapses going
Alright just a quick check
Its okay if youre not all the way done these ones are a little more challenging
Get our brains really thinking this morning
Please erase your whiteboard
Its okay
My friends I want to remind you were going to go back to our seats in just a moment
We are going to complete problem 1 on journal page 201 but I have to remind you of todays success criteria
Remember every time we solve problems today hold up three fingers
Show me three fingers right now
Every time you solve problems today our success is we have three steps
I want to hear your voices first step is what
Break the problem into parts
Second step
Determine how the units are related
Third step
Make a rule using exponential notation
Instead of saying we multiplied by 1000 you would say we multiply by 103
Now when it says determine how the units are related youre going to have some problems today that say things like how many millimeters are in one centimeter
How many millimeters are in one meter
Thats what I mean by determine how the units are related
How many millimeters are in one meter
Thats what I mean by units
Youre going to go ahead and put your whiteboards away
You are going to solve problem 1 on journal page 201
Were going to start by solving by ourselves
Go
Go
There is a pen on the carpet if somebody left a white pen with a blue lid
Do we have someone thats already on page 201 problem 1
Ms James let me see here
Wow look at this team back here
Were almost there page 201
This is your math mesIvy
Problem 1 page 201
Im watching the clock
Im going to give you about two minutes
Go
Go
Just Problem number one
Just problem number one
Check the front board if youre not sure what to do right now
Math mesIvy one
Just thought Id wake you up this morning
Fletcher youre going to have a partner activity with the rest of the page so please dont go on
Remember our steps
We want to make sure that we are breaking it into parts thinking about the units and answering with a rule using what powers of
10
10
Did you answer with powers of 10
Oh
Make sure your rule is expressed using powers of 10 or exponents
Jack would you mind sharing with us what is this problem asking us to do
Its asking us what are the rules
We need to figure out the rule
What information do we have to help us get started
We have the first problem we solved for the first part
The first part of the rule so tell us what that means
that
In one meter we have how many centimeters
A 100
Class
100
100 so if we had 2 meters how many centimeters would we have
200
Help me out
Were going to keep going three meters
300
Four meters
400
Five meters
500
What was the rule or pattern
Anyone willing to share
Times 102
Oh I saw a lot of kids write times 100
How did you know it was times 10 multiplied by time 102 tell us your thinking
Because I saw that we are adding up
That means we would be shifting the decimal two places to the right making the product bigger
Amazing math thinking
We shifted the decimal two places to the right
We are multiplying our rule is times 102
I love your hand signals is that showing you agree
Amazing math thinking
Friends that just gets us started with todays math thinking
Please put your pencils down
I see some of you are going so fast and I love that but you have a job on the rest of this page
You will be doing Ivy and scribe on problems 2 and 3
What do you know about Ivy and scribe
Have we done it before
Yes
Im thinking so
Pencils down
Pencils down
Would you please stand up right now go find the partnerT2asked you to partner up with earlier today and I want you to stand up with that partner with your journal and pencil
Go
Go
Stand up
Find your partner for math today
My friends would you please put your pencils down
Gentlemen and ladies Id like your pencils down
Remember we talked about active listening really really listening this morning
We are looking at the metric system today
Have you ever noticed that there are different ways to measure for example some people use inches some people use centimeters
Have you noticed that
Please put your pencils down
Thank you
The metric system is the measuring system that most of the world uses
Scientists and most countries in the world use the metric system but in the United States we use US customary
Do I know why
Not really but most science math and other countries use metric
We will almost always be using metric when were studying math
That means millimeters centimeters kilometers liters kilograms kilometers
Thats the system were using
Everything in the metric system is based on 10s powers of 10
Take a peek at our front whiteboard
When centimeters are divided by 102 the decimal point shifts two places to the what
Left
Left
The digits and then if you are multiplying by powers of 10 the digits shift two places to the right
In the metric system the whole metric system is based on powers of 10
I just wanted you to be aware of that
You have a job with this partner you are just looking at my hands
Were just solving numbers
One
It should say two and three not one and two
You are just solving numbers two and numbers three
This should say number two and this should say number three
One of you if you are the scribe you are the writer if you are the Ivy you are the
Talker
Explainer youre the Mrs Travers
Then on number three the other person partner B will be the scribe and partner A will be the Ivy
That means you wont have both problems completed
If youre partner A youre only answering number two only number two will be filled out in your book
If you are partner B the other partner only number three will be filled out in your book because we are practicing listening
Really listen to your Ivy and how your Ivy helps you solve
Maya will you read  what it says in red at the bottom
When you finish number two and three youre going to flip to math boxes
Thats howT3and I will know youre done and youre ready for the next step
If youre stuck there are three questions you and your partner can ask each other
They are on the board
What problems are you solving right now
Two
Two and Three
If you have the lighter color shoes you are the scribe for number two
Youre solving number two
If you have the darker colored shoes you are solving number three
Ready
Go
Go
Whos two on this problem
Faith youre explainin number two
Ivy is the talker
We are converting between centimeters and millimeters
What do we know Aaron
We know theres
We know if you have 1 is equals to
Think back to Remember our success criteria where our rule has to be expressed in a power of
Oh yes
Youre right
So far do we think Aaron is right
47 so its 10 to
To power of
If you move the decimal one place
To the power of one
How do you know that
Go back to Faith
I know  to the power of 1 because youre adding one 0 and then moving the decimal point one place over
Is you product larger or smaller
Larger
You move the decimal one place to there
Now Aaron you are the Ivy and youre explaining number three to Faith
Yes
Okay here we go
Aaron why dont you read that for us
The rule is
If we look at
All your decimals are right here and youre dividing by 10
Where do they go now
Is our outbox getting bigger or smaller
What do you think Faith
This is 2
How did you know
If you start with 1000 and your answer is 1 is our answer larger or smaller
Smaller
When you divide youre dividing something into pieces and its getting smaller
dividing to the power of three
10 to the third power
Yes
What do you need to fix
There we go right
Now what
If you were doing  hops you would move the hops right one two three places
You guys are doing great
Keep going
Can I help you guys
Lets think about if you know youre dividing by 10 to the third power youre going to be moving the decimal how many places
Two
Which way left or right
Left
If right now the decimals is right here were going to move it one two three
Whats your new answer
Because we made this smaller
Now were going to have to reverse it going this way
Our goal is to read and listen to each other to help each other understand
You could help her be the Ivy and you guys do need to solve these  too
Whats the rule
Talk through how do you know that this is 8000
You know this is 8000 because
Use this name tag right here
Heres the decimal
tenths hundredths thousandths three places to get right to the decimal
We divided by 10 to this
Now we need to multiply
This is ones tens hundreds thousands places right here
Are you doing multiplying
All the other places
You are going to have a sevendigit number
I put zeros in front of it
Seven digits
Nine in the thousands
After
Just remember when you multiply
One in the hundredths
Where is the hundredths
If thats your decimal where is the hundredths
What does that mean
Thats tens
Here hundredths is right here
Equals 0 0 8
Were in the tens not tenths tens so thats right here
Did you say zero
Eight in the thousandths which is way over here and 2s in all the other places
In here
920
Is there something in the
Okay that should be a 2
10 divide by
Do we do page
Have you figured out what the rule is
Yes
Times 10
1 times 10 is 10
It says which number sentence matches the picture below
Fill in the circle next to the best answer
Youre moving the decimal one place right
If youre moving it one place to the right were going to reverse it one place to the left
Its 1
50 youre going to have the decimal
If this is where the decimal is right now we want to move that one place to the left
This is where the decimal is right now
We need to move it one place to the left
If this is where the decimal is right now we need to move it one place to the left
Pam
Pam pam
Awesome job fifth graders
I need you to please bring your journal and pencil to the carpet
Quickly and quietly
Go
Go
Miss Vance can we just leave these here
Yes okay
Awesome job coming quickly
Everybody freeze
Why is this doing this
There we go
Okay we are going to take a quick look at the answer key
Mrs Travers is getting back in math mode back into fifth grade mode is really what I mean to do
I want to get back to every day math right
Yes escape
I dont know why its
Are you comfortable drawing somewhere so its a triangle
Erase
Its trying to erase it
Yes I thought about it
I just want to show them how to relate the answer key
Right
Right
Okay
All right my friends if you could please take a quick look up here on the screen
I want you to check your thinking
I stopped by a couple of kids desks and we were talking about is the rule multiply times 10
That is correct but we talked about in our success criteria we need to have our rule be written as a what
Power of
10
I want you to check your rules
Do you have times 10 to the first power
Yes
Okay
If you dont I asked you to bring your pencils so you can check it right now please okay
Then my friends in number three the rule would be divided by 10 to the what
Power of three
Third power
Okay
Would you please check your number two and your number three that you have with your partner right now
Miss Vance and I would like you to do number four by yourself and this is what its going to show us
Were going to take a quick check and were going to say okay some of our classmates might need more practice with this and thats okay
Some of our classmates might have this right now and thats okay too
Were going to ask you to do number four by yourself so that we can know are you one of those kiddos that needs a few more minutes of practice with a Mrs Travers or with a partner or are you one of those kiddos thats ready to keep going with this on your own
Okay
Would you please bring your book to your desk and would you please solve number four by yourself
When you are done with number four
Oh its not 1000
Its 1000
Thats 20000
Is it
Milli is a prefix that means 1000
Centi is the prefix that means 100
Milligram there must be what
100000
There are 1000
If milli means thousand how many milligrams are there in a gram
100000
100000
100000
Okay
When youre done with number four please do a quick hand raise and Miss Vance and I will give you your next steps
Im going to start from 1 gram to 1000 milligrams
Okay
Okay
Thats what we know
We know that were converting milligrams to grams
Write down milligrams grams
We need to read the directions
Yes
What do we know
We know its milligrams to grams and how many milligrams are in one gram
100000
100000
You need to know that
1000 milligrams 1 gram
Thats what you need for the problem
Okay
Okay
You are on the right track but milligrams are tiny grams so my hint to you is first this is 1 milligram is 1000 not 10
Thats going to change this
I also want you to know that this is going to be a smaller number because were starting with big and were moving Miss Vance what do you think about this
She just reversed it
Thats what a lot of them are doing
I think thats okay
Okay
Right
Right
This would be 10 to the third right
Right
Right
You just did it the opposite way which is fine you still get
I think thats fine right
They do need to flip it
They need to go
We need to be doing this as a division not a multiplication
Yes
You have the right thinking but were dividing not multiplying
Come right back
Okay
Ive seen a lot of them
Theyre not reading this
No I didnt read it
Miss Vances class we need to have a quick commercial break
I used to always have to do this with my fifth graders
Theres a couple of little tips that I think if Miss Vance and I give you these couple of little tips its going to help you a little bit okay
Friends I want you to look up here
We are going from milligrams 43 milligrams is how many grams
Milligrams are teeny tiny
How many milligrams are in a gram
There are 1000 milligrams in 1 gram
This is what your rule would start out as okay
Then because were going from milligrams to grams we are going to be dividing
1000 is 10 to what power
Third
10 the the third power
Thats all Im going to show you up there so that that can help you
Miss Vance and I are now ready to check
When youre ready for us to look at your answer youll raise your hand high and well give you your next step
I think were dividing it there
I think were multiplying
Thats why I wanted to show that to you
I dont think this will have to do anything
Yes move on to the next page
Oh okay
Were doing page 202
202
Miss Vance 202 is the next job
202
202
The next page
You may move on to the next page
You may move on to the next page
This is what you have 43 milligrams
Youre using this number right here
Thats the problem youre solving
I dont know you mightve got it right
Erase this and put a 43 right here
Then youre going to come up with the out
If youre dividing it by 10 to the power of 3
Look at the rule
Howd you
Yes but what goes right here is this
Okay
Thats the problem were solving
How many grams are in 43 milligrams
Put your answer here
Youre close
May I see your pencil
If you wrote 43 milligrams how many places are you moving the decimal
Right or left
One two three
Youre only going to have one zero not two
Youre welcome
Yes move on to page 202
Yes move on to page 202
Hi Owen
It starts over here
Then just move it 3 to the left
Were just about going to
I know were just about ready to
This is what goes here because theyre saying how many grams are in 43 milligrams
This is your answer
You have it you just dont have it in the right place
You are super close
I want to show you something
Do you see how this has 20 to the third power
If this is what youre starting with 43 and the decimals right here we need to go like this
One two three and now the decimals here
Youre new answer is
See why
Do you see how I did that
Were moving the decimal three places to the left
Good
You can move on to the next page
How many centimeters are in a meter
Centi means 100 and you also have a little cheat sheet right here in the front of your book
Centi mean 100
Bumbadabumbum
Bumbum
Ms Vances class I have to tell you I am so proud of the incredible math thinking weve had in here today
Youre job right now is to take a pause from math
Put your pencil in your book and close it
Were going to do a little activity to get our bodies moving
Then youll get your snack
Wait eating
Eating
We have to go get our snacks and
I know
One two three clap
If you can hear me clap once
If you can hear me clap twice
If you can hear me clap three times
Now were going to do a little activity with standing clapping and partnering
Would you please stand up and find your same partner that you were with for Ivy and scribe
You dont need to bring anything its not math
You have five seconds to find your partner and I want to see you with a high ten like this
Ready go
Youre going to need some space
Youre going to need some space
This is to get our brains moving and have some fun
We all know that we can count to three
One two three
Aaron cant
Well guess what
Ms Vance and I are going to show you an activity
Have you done this yet
Yes we did it in
I know but has the class done it
No
Okay  Vance and Mrs Travers
Were going to play this little game about one two three
First round is just counting back and forth
Ready
One
Two
Three
One
Two
Three
One
Two
Three
One
Two
Three
One
Two

Nice job
Our second round is
I dont get it
I get it
I get it
If Ms Vance friends
Hold on were still explaining
If one of us made a mistake
Shed be out
we would laugh
No ones out
We would high five and we would start over because in this game there are lots of mistakes
Ready for round I want to show you round two
This is where it gets good
Ready
GOD
We cant say number one anymore
We can only clap for a one
Ready
Go
Go
Two
Three
Two
Three
Two
Three
Two
Three

Nice job
I clapped
Tada
If you make a mistake you do this
Tada because we all make mistakes and we celebrate them
Partner up ready
First partner youre just doing one two three
One two three
Ready go
