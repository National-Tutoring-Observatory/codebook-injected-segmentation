If you do not get one of these yellow goldenrod papers that means that you did not turn it in to me
I did not put a grade on that
Really the only people that were close to a three were Allison Adrianna and Catalina
Those were the people that theirs were
I did not write a grade
They were closest to a three
We looked at them us fifthgrade Ms Carrolls and I sorted the people that were possibly a two a one a three
I didnt put a grade on it because thats not what I want you to focus on
I want you to focus on how to what would make this paper a three
Then you can look into your paper and see Do I have these things and if I dont what do I need to do differently
Heres one without a name
All right so lets First of all can I have someone volunteer to read the problem
Okay Adrianna
Analyze these numbers 7568 and 955
Write a number that has a nine and that is onetenth the value of the nine in the number and eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number
So we are working on deconstructing the prompt in writing
If we were to look at this and deconstruct this first of all what are our verbs that we would circle
What are our verbs
Byron
Analyze
Okay survey circle the word analyze
Okay
Whats another one  Byron
Write
Write
So circle write
Allison
Prove
And prove
Those are the three that you want to circle
Those are the three things that you want to make sure that youre doing when you are doing this problem
You want to analyze it and analyze means what
Focus on it and look closely
Okay look closely at it
Write we know what write means
Then we need to prove that our answer is going to work
Do you feel okay
You just look kind of pale
All right so lets look at this so we can all see this together
Ms  does this
Yes it moves towards me
Youre not able to see me right now but I dont know that it matter
Okay
They can hear what youre saying too so  all right so if we look at this we first have to look at this number and it says Analyze this number
Were looking for the eight and the nine
If I were to write this number I might underline these two because those two numbers are the only ones that are going to change
Okay so talk in your team and talk about whats going to happen to the eight and whats going to happen to the nine
Talk in your teams about what needs to happen to the eight and the nine
All right close up your conversations
Close up your conversations
Frankie what did your team say needs to happen to the eight
They said it needs to be switched around to the ninth place
But they said they need to be switched around
Okay so these two need to be switched
Eight and nine need to be switched
Yes
Did your team say why they think that
No
Collin what did your team say
They said that youre supposed to switch the nine and the eight so the ninth to the 10th space then  by one
Now it is in the tenth place
Are they saying to keep it in the tenth place
No
Does somebody want to help him
Okay so you think Which five the first five or the second five
The ninth
Okay so you want to change this right here you want that part of it to look like that
Andrea
The eight needs to go to where the six is
Because
The eight needs to go to the tenth
All right so show me if you agree or disagree with where the eight and the nine are right lets start with the eight agree or disagree in the place of the eights at
Thumbs up or thumbs down
Bianca will you show her where the  is
Now those of you that have their thumb up you are correct but why
I need to know why its going there Jared
Because when they said eight has to go ten times the value of where the eight is so it would be going up a place
Adrianna what do you want to add on
It just says an eight that is ten times the value of the eight in the number
That means you would have to do 8 x 10 so that would be 80 and 80 would be in the tenth place
Thats going to help us with our explanation
8 x 10 tells us that the eight goes in the tenth place
We want to use math vocabulary when we write out our explanation
So what about the nine do you agree or disagree where the nine is
Remember we had that verb prove how can we prove that the nine needs to go there
Damien
It says Write a number that has nine and that 110 is not a full number so youre not going forward you have to go backwards
If you multiply a whole number by a fraction
Its going to be
Its going to be what
Its going to be a hundredths
Its going to get smaller
In this case youre right its going to go to the hundredths because it started in the tenths
Now here I could write does this number right here fit the rule
3281595 does that number fit the rule
Where does three come from
Thats what I wanted you guys you were trying to make it with this number and that may have been the confusing part
Maybe not
You could have switched numbers that would have been fine too just like whoever told me to put Was it Catalina
Yes
Whoever told me to put the nine between the two fives thats fine or I could totally make those five something else as long as that nine is in the hundredths place
Heres what I would say in a problem like this even if you had multiple nines as long as you have a nine in the hundredth  as your Ms Carroll I dont know if that tells me that you fully understand
Well except theres an eight
It would go nine nine nine nine nine nine nine
Nine
Nine nine nine eight eight eight
I think its better if you can just have one nine and one eight
What Im really looking at is that in the hundredths place you have the right number and in the tenths place you have the right number
Heres where the tricky part comes heres my answer
Heres my explanation
This is where I want you to really look
Allison lets hear yours
Who are my three people that were close to a three
Were going to listen to theirs first
Allison lets hear yours
My explanation was I know this is the answer because if you take the nine and switch it with the first five after the decimal then you get 0595
Then if you switch the eight with the six in 7568 that is how I got 7586595
Whats possibly missing
She didnt say why those places go there
I understand that she gets it but she didnt say why
If she would have said The reason I put it there was because it said that it should be 10 times more so 8 x 10 is 80 which would make it get put in that place
Adrianna lets hear yours
You want me to do the answers first
I want you to read your explanation
I did 10 x 8 so in 10550 and 955  7586955
What I did with the nine is I made it go to the 100th place because it says nine  is 110 the value so I would make the nine go in the one hundredth
She has the why
I dont know she might have
I dont get Never mind
Lets look when we do this lets see if theres a reason
I put three and I put the three of you under the three but I felt like there was something that maybe Allisons it was the why
Im not sure about yours Adrianna
Lets hear yours Catalina
Her why she has part of her why but its not completely clear
Lets look at what would make this good
I want to click over and show you something that we wrote down if I can find it that I want us to look at together
Lets look at this
Heres some things that are going to make this its this problem some things that are going to make it right that you get a three
Check yours Adrianna
Correct answer eight in the tenths and nine in the hundredths
Put a thumb up if you did that
If you didnt put a thumb down if you got that part of it
That was a silly mistake
The next one says explain the correct answer using I think I just figured it out using details and math vocabulary hundredths tenths place place value 10 times 110
If you use some of those math vocabulary and you had correct details do a thumbs up
Did you use transition words
Thats
where I think
Did you restate the question
All right
Looking at this we have the correct answer
We need to restate the question I changed 7568955 to 3281595 because I had  Im not done restating
I had to change the 8 to be 10 times larger and the 9 to be 110 smaller
First heres my transition words first  get rid of that
Whats distracting over here
First I multiplied here is a math term 8 x 10  80
I moved my 8 from the 1s place to the 10ths place not 10
Next I multiplied 910 by 110 and that equals 900th
I moved the nine to the hundredth
What
Oh that was a decimal thing we were doing
I got the final answer of 3281595
Thats because there was another 10
Adrianna
If I multiplied 10 by eight would that be sort of three I guess
Yes I think the only thing you were missing did you restate
No of course I didnt
Then did you use transition words
Probably not
I used transition words
Now heres what I want you to do
I want you to flip this over and if for some reason you dont have this paper then get a piece of paper
Ms Carroll No Im going to give you a new one
Im going to give you a new one and you can work on it as a team
Sit down lets sit down
Heres the new one
Up for the eight I dont want a zero in it
So write a number
Do you want us to explain it to
Yes
You dont have to
All right write a number with a 6 that has 110 the value and an 8 that has 10 times the value
Youre going to write a number and then youre going to explain what you did restating the question and using transitions
You can decide do you want to do it with somebody at your team or do you want to do it by yourself
You can decide but work on this right now and then Im going to collect them
Okay friends the first one is a comma and this one is a decimal point
Now this one I am going to grade
Use transitions
Im going to set a ten minute timer
Okay now do your explanations
Usually you have to go with this first
Okay then where the other one youre moving is the eight
Where does this eight go it says its ten times bigger than it is now so where would the eight go
When youre done you can put it in your pocket
You could start off I changed this number to
I took because of mine and I said because one tenth because the nine had to be one tenth and the eight had to be ten times the size  then I want to
This put it in your pocket either way doesnt matter
