Okay you ready
We are going to try various strategies to add mixed numbers that have denominators who can remind us what a mixed number is
Compared to an improper fraction those two things we touched about yesterday mixed number compared to an improper fraction
Jeremy remembers Georgia remembers Kyle remembers
Theres more stuff you can just put them right here on there thank you
Yes thats full
Anyone else has a  folder
I dont have pink sheets but Ill put them in because I havent done it yet
If you did not turn in your  folder go do it now please
Okay mixed number Nick do you think you remember what a mixed number is
I think its a number that I forgot
What do you think Cooper
I think its like an uneven fraction with the denominator  and its like an uneven number with an even number as a denominator and you have to break it down to something that
You mean uneven as in odd
What do you mean when you say uneven
Like that thing when you did like last time when we had two even fractions with one and then ten
Cameron can you add on or clarify or explaining what youre thinking
I think mixed numbers mixed fractions are
Mixed numbers you were right
Its like one and one half or one and three thirds or something like that
Its a mix of a whole number and a fraction so one and a half or three and two fourths or ten and a third
It has whole numbers to it and fractions to it Cameron good way to explain that
Mixed number is a mix of wholes and parts
Were going to add those today it might be if I have one and a third cups of blueberries and I pour it into another cup and two thirds how many cups do I have altogether
Were going to figure out two different ways to solve problems when youre adding mixed numbers you got it when you can determine what the whole is youve got it when you can generate a number model with unknowns and you can solve that mixed number story problem accurately
Questions on those
Youre a mental math today
Youre writing decimals use your place value chart on your name tag if you need it how do you write onetenth or how many wholes theyre in onetenth
Zero
Onetenth think about how you say that what place is that one going to go in use your place value chart threetenths ninetenths twohundredths ninehundredths or 80 hundredths and then we have mixed numbers two and 13 hundredths nine and 56 hundredths 12 and 87 hundredths
Pick one from each color then math
Solve using your fraction circle pieces or the number line poster
You also have a number line poster in math journal number one you can use that
Two and onefourth is the same thing as how many fourths
Youre taking a mixed number and youre converting it into an improper fraction
If you have two whole ones and a fourth how many fourths would that be altogether
Think think think
One pink one green one blue
Think through that problem Ill give you about 10 minutes
Why are you eating candy right now
Put the  away please
Do that first one and then 12 so I think it should be one and how many whole numbers do I have
Did  somethings  and or just onetenth
Onetenth
I have whole numbers tenths and onehundredths
Where would I put onetenth
said one or did I say onetenth and then theres nothing here because I didnt say two and onetenth or five and  two onehundredths or twohundredths
Where do I put the
If I have that there  13hundredths where do I put the two
People are drawing pictures to help them with that math message problem thats a good idea
Give you about another minute and a half or so
One more minute
Okay
If you are working in your Math journal on Math boxes close it up please
Help your teammate set their table if they didnt hear that direction
All right
How many of you use the place value flip chart rather than writing up here all the different place values in their columns
Who did the first pink problem
Onetenth
Okay Brian
Tell me what I should have as my decimal
For your decimal youve got zero
You start with zero whole ones
Zero whole one and onetenth and zero
I could have that blank
For the first decimal 01 is the same thing as zero and onetenth
Okay
Is it okay if I have that
Yes
Its okay
Is onetenth equal to 10 onehundredths
Who did the second pink problem
Ada tell me what I should have as my decimal
Zero ones and three tenths
Okay
Zero whole ones three tenths so 03
Is it okay to have 030
You can even do 0300
You could add a million zeroes on the end and it would still be three tenths because that is the only value
Everything else is nothing
Okay
How about the last pink one
Trey tell me what I need to have in the ones
In the ones you should have zero and in the tenths you should have nine and then the hundredths could be blank
Okay
Zero and ninetenths
Are we clear
Super duper awesome or no
Do we forget how to do this
Is that okay
Okay
All right
Now we are looking at hundredths
Im going to put this back to the beginning
Who did the first green problem
tell me what you did
I did zero zero and a two
Zero ones or zero whole ones
Are there any tenths in twohundredths
If you think back to our unifix cubes or our big ten blocks the little tiny cubes are the hundredths
How many longs do we have if we have two little cubes
We dont have any
002 is two hundredths
The second green problem
Who did the second green problem nine onehundredths
Jeremy what should I have
Zero point zero
Okay
009 or zero and nine hundredths
Last problem
Tricky tricky
Finn tell me what you wrote
8
You think back to little cubes
How many little cubes would I have if I had 80 hundredths
80 of them
80 of them
Or just 008
You are telling me I would have eight little cubes
We want this to say 80
80 hundredths is the same thing as
Okay
I want you to always picture when we are talking about tenths
Those are the longs
When we are talking about hundredths those are the little cubes
If you have 80 little cubes you really have you could combine them together it will be eight longs
Okay
If this were eight hundredths Finn you would have been correct
Do 008
Okay
All right
First blue problem
Who did two and 13 hundredths
Jude tell me what to do
What I did is I did zero and 26
Thats what you have
26
Kennedy read that to me as it is a decimal
Zero ones and 26 hundredths
Is that what we have
Zero ones
See how that number is a little bit bigger
Its hard to see when it is typed up on the board
Read that number to me Tucker
This one
Two
Two
Two hundredths two ones
Two ones
Two
Two
What do we say when we see the decimal
And
And
When you have a whole number and then a fraction after this is a mixed number
Two and how many hundredths do we want
Really well have 213
Two means the whole number
If the numbers bigger that is how many ones there are
Okay
What about nine and 56 hundredths
Byron
I did nine ones and 56 hundredths
Read it
Nine
Last one 12 and 87 hundredths
Graham
I put
I need a new column dont I
I put one in the tens column two in the ones column eight in the tens column and seven in the hundreds column
Okay
Read that now
12 and 87 hundredths
Try it again
12 and 87 hundredths
Okay
Think of that as money
That would be like 12 dollars and 87 cents
Okay
Thats that
Going back and spiraling back to things that weve practiced in the past
Not like it ever goes away my friends
We will continue practicing over and over
All right
Now to our math
You think fraction circles in your brain or drawing fraction circles or using that number line poster two and onefourths is equal to how many fourths
Only one person two people got that threefourths
Caleb what were you doing to help you figure that out
I used I knew that two get the whole numbers two was equal to two of them whole number of the denominator so I added four plus four which was eight
Why four plus four
Tell me more about that
Because the whole we had two wholes and the denominators four so we have to add that Because the denominator is a whole so to have four you need two wholes to have two quarters so I added four plus four which was eight and added the one that was in the fraction next to them
It was one whole which was nine out of the whole
I can follow your thinking however I still dont know that youve explained how you figured out four plus four where did you get four
You keep telling me the denominator is a four but we dont add denominators
Were talking about fourths
Tell me a little bit more about that
The denominator was the four thats the whole and since we have two wholes we have to have the wholes add to get Because at the top to have a whole it will need to be four out of four
Thank you thats what we were looking for
What is one whole if we cut it into four parts
How many fourths would that be
Four
Four
Thats what you are missing my dear friend
Fourfourths is one whole thing
So if we have one whole thing here and one whole thing here that takes care of the two whole things
We can add fourfourths plus another fourfourths and thats where Caleb got eight
We have eight fourths right now but are we done with all of our fourths
No
We have another Okay
We actually have how many total fourths
If we have fourfourths
Nine
plus fourfourths and another fourth
Nine
ninefourths
We just took a mixed number and turned it into an improper fraction
When your top number is bigger then your bottom number is called improper because its too heavy on top
Okay
Were going to practice a couple more
Does everyone understand where Caleb got fourfourths
And he added another fourfourths
Yes
If we had a picture this other fourth would look like that
Its fourfourths plus fourfourths plus one more fourth
Are they all the same shape pieces
What shape pieces are they
What fraction of a piece is it
Whole
Ready
Oh thats not it
How about this
Okay heres the new problem
Were going to turn it into a story problem
Jeff can you read that from where you are
Yes
Can you read that please
The cafeteria has had two threefifths of grape jelly and one onefifth tubs of strawberry jelly set aside for breakfast
How many tubes of jelly were there in all
Okay
Were starting with two and threefifths tubs of the jelly
Were adding another one and onefifth tubs of jelly okay
Clear off your whiteboard and do this problem with me please
Zach how many whole tubs of jelly do we have right here
Two
Two of them
Im going to draw myself two whole circles and I have another what fraction of a tub added to that
Threefifths
Threefifths
This other tub is going to be cut into five parts but I only have three of them
I almost have three but not quite
Okay and Im going to add another tub of strawberry because we have one whole and how many parts of another tub of strawberry jelly
What fraction
Onefifth
Another fifth
One more fifth
Right here I have two and threefifths
Im going to add one and onefifth
What could I start with to help me solve this problem
Elizabeth what could I start with to help me start solving this problem
You can add the two and the one together
I can start with the whole numbers
I know I have two whole tubs here and another whole tub here
How many whole tubs do I have
Three
Right now I have three full tubs of jelly
I can start with the whole numbers and those together
After I do that Preston what would I add next
You would add the
I took care of this part and I took care of this part
Whats left to work together or add together
Add the fractions
I could add the fractions together
Do I know how to add threefifths plus another fifth
Yes
Which will give me how many fifths
Fourfifths
Fourfifths
That is one way of to solve your problems start with the whole numbers like Elizabeths said and then add your fractional parts together
Here is another thing you can do that might be easier for some of you to figure out
Come on
Could I cut all my tubs of jelly into fifths
Yes
How many fifths is in a whole tub of jelly
Five
Fivefifths is one whole tub
Im talking about the whole fivefifths
That gives me two whole tubs of jelly plus another threefifths
How many fifths is in this full tub of jelly
Five
Five plus another how many right here
One
Could I add together fivefifths plus fivefifths plus threefifths plus fivefifths plus onefifth
Yes
Lets focus on our fives
Count the five
Five 10 15 16 17 18 19
19 fifths
Fifths
Its okay if you come up with an improper fraction for these problems
You can make them all out of equal parts and then add them together
You got to see the
These two things are equal
How many fives are there in 19
Five 10 15
Thats three whole ones
If I took 15 of those whole ones away whats 19 take those 15 away what am I left with
19 minus 15 is
Four
Those two things are equal it doesnt matter how you write them
Your turn
Youre going to do this
Try this one
Ben will you read that to us
Her name is Sophie
Sophie works at the deli
She sliced one and threeeighths pounds of ham and then stopped to help a customer
When she was done she sliced another two and seveneights of a pound
How many pounds of the ham did she
Tell me Cameron what is my number model going to look like
Whats my equation going to look like
One plus threeeighths plus two seveneights
Theres our number model with an unknown
You may do add the whole numbers first then add the fractions or you may turn then into improper fractions and then just add them together
When you think you have it would you please give me a thumbs up
Then Im going to throw a wrench in it for you
fraction
What happened to them
You have one full pound plus three more eighths
You have two more pounds plus seveneighths but you only end up with seven
Im going to ask you how you got that
I think youre the only one so far
Hes got his just fine
Most of you came up with this answer
Raise your hand if you got three and teneighths
All right that is technically right
You have three pounds plus ten more eighths pounds of ham slices however mathematically its inappropriate to have a mixed number wholes with fractions and your fraction be an improper fraction
Its just not the way that we do math in the world
Graham tell me what you wrote on your board
Four and twoeighths
Four and twoeighths
His answer looks really different from your answer but hes right
Because how many eights does it take to make one more full pound
Listen carefully how many eights does it take to make one more full pound
Eight eights
Eight eights
Eight eights equals one whole pound
If you take eight of those eight and bump it over its almost like when you have 13 you have three ones and one 10 but you cant put them in one column one place
You could bump those eight eights and make another whole one which makes it four but there are still twoeights of a pound sitting there
Nobody did it as an improper fraction as your answer
Not a single one of you
Im the only one that did that
Yes that I saw I dont know for a fact
Lets make this an improper fraction how many eighths is 1 whole
Eight
This right here is eighteighths plus another threeeighths
Hi Blake
We would have eighteighths plus another eighteighths when we have two whole ones
Whats eight plus eight
16 eighths plus another seveneights
If you add all those eighths together anyone know what you get
16 17 18 19 plus 15 more whats 19 plus 15
34
I added 16 17 18 19 plus 15 more
Nobody did that but you could if it made sense in your brain
Ready to start practicing
Jeremy has a very important question for you all to hear can you repeat that very important question
Is it the wrong answer
If you write your mixed number your whole number with your fraction and this is bigger in value than this technically not the right way to do it
For today if thats the only way you can get there Im going to let that slide but we have to really work hard at knowing if I have ninefifths thats more than one whole thing how many of those fifths does it take to make another whole thing
Five
Five of them
I could take those fivefifths out and bump it over to my whole number bump my whole number up one
Its a lot like when youre adding normal numbers and you get to too many digits in the ones place you have to carry it over
If you have too many parts of a fraction you got to carry it over to become a whole number
All right look at your math journal page please
It is page number 162
We will work together to just get the first part started and then Ill let you work
Thank you Preston for being ready
Quick transition
Cooper can you please read number one this persons name is Balram
Balram
You just say B
Balram drew a line segment two and onefourth inches long then he made a line segment one and twofourths inches longer
How long is the line segment now
All right what is the whole thing were talking about
What measurement
Line segments
What is the whole
Think
Its one inch
One inch is the whole thing
Lets consider that whole
He drew two whole inches plus another fourth of an inch then he added on another whole inch plus twofourths of another inch on
Finn can you tell me what the number model with an unknown will look like
Equals
Question mark
You can do a letter or you doing question mark
Question mark
Question mark
You just have to decide one way if you would like to do adding your whole numbers first and then adding your fractions you may do that
If you would like to turn them all into improper fractions and then add to create an improper fraction you may do that
Notice what D says Kennedy what does D say
It says answer with unit
With unit that word needs to be at the end whatever your answer is needs to be labeled with
Inch
Inches
This ones an easy one because it turns out to be an okay mixed number
Ill get it
Im not going to give you the answer for that you guys are going to figure it out you are welcome to work with people at your tables today
Stay where you are
The microphones are there for your discussions to happen
Im turning mine off so that it can hear you go
You guys are not listening to directions
You guys heard me what did I say
To work with people at your table
At your tables
Work with people at your tables
So you can move around at your table but were not going off to different directions
Were sitting at our table
Well be done in about 16 minutes
What
Wait so 44 plus 44 plus 44 equals 164 plus 24 plus 14 equals 194
Times up
Two minutes
What
Oh yes
No it actually
I have it
I have it
You have to do the rule you cant do any more
Nathan youre doing it wrong
You have to do rule but you cant You have to do the rule
Yes ask her
She said you have to
I did the rule Tucker
LaLaLaLa LaLaLaLaLa
You dont know what 6  3 is
