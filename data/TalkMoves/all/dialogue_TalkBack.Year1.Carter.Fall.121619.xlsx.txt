Thank you
Rate yourself on how well you could explain how to subtract using any of the three methods that we reviewed on Friday
Seems like most people are feParkerng proficient
If youre not showing me a three whose responsibility is it to get that help and that practice
Most people are pointing back at themselves so make sure you get that help all right
Before we start more I neglected to take hot lunch count so please raise your hand nice and high if you are eating hot lunch here at school today
Three four seven eight nine thank you
All right for slate today we are going to practice rounding
So Im going to dictate remember dictating makes it easy explaining
Dictate decimals and you round it to indicate a place
You re five minutes late
Oopsy there we go
What is 37 rounded to the nearest one
Flash
Four
Excellent
If you said four you were correct
This one 203 rounded to the nearest one
Flash
Two
Good people are saying two excellent
What is 781 round it to the nearest tenth
Flash
Good if you said 78 youre right
What did people do that said eight
They wrote eight on their slate what did they do Stella
I was not listening
Okay we like that admission
You rounded it to the nearest one rather than the tenths right
Yes
Okay so better be careful listeners
This next page Im going to tell you the number and youre going to write it and then well check to make sure you have the right number before I tell you what to round it to okay
So write 093
Flash
Nicely done round it to the nearest tenth
Flash
Good job everybody say that number with me
9
Like that do the next one
Write 265
Flash
Good work
Keeps it 265 round it to the nearest tenth
Flash
Good job
Say that number with me
27
Like that write 0681
Does anybody know where Banders slate is
Its walked away from him
Theyre always doing that this time of year
I know those troubling slates
I like how people are looking in their desks
Always hiding
Thank you
All on your mind
Flash
Great job
Round this number to the nearest hundredth into hundredth
You found it
Thank you
Flash
Great lets say that number
68
All right heres your next one
Write 72894
Flash
Good and Ill show you up here so you can check yours
You notice theres no comma even though we said 2000 that was just to help you understand
So 72894
This is thousandths
No thats ten thousandths
Look in your planners and break it down into that place value that fourth place value if you dont bParkereve me
Round it to the nearest thousandth
Flash
To the nearest thousandth
Great job lets say that number
7289
Heres your next one
Write 82930
Flash
Good job
Im going to open the window so you can verify digits
82938
Do you see why it s ten thousandths
Because you were in the thousandths and then ten thousandths
What comes after ten thousandths
Hundred thousandths
Then youd get to millionths
Okay does that make sense
Yes
Round this to the nearest thousandth
Flash
Great lets say it out loud
8294
I want you to explain to your shoulder partners how you rounded this
Its partner A s turn to explain that so partner A explain it to your shoulder partner
Ready
Go
Go
Back to me please
Heres your last one
Write 6994
Flash
I cant see yours Emma
Thank you
Great so it should have been 6994
Thank you God bless you
Round it to the nearest 10
Flash
Youre going to talk to your teams about your answer
Person four start a conversation
Ready
Go
Go
Great now flash me your answer please
Yes now I have to form digit seven
I understand why it s seven I need to talk about this
Im not quite clear why its seven
Thank you
Lets look at our learning intention please
Here we go
Read this with me please
I will use previously learned strategies to add and subtract decimals to balance a bank statement
What does the word previously mean
Partner B you tell your shoulder partner what does previously means
Back to me please
Thank you
Parker what does previously mean
My partner says its something that its already been done its something that already has happened to me
Im seeing a lot of people agreeing with the thumbs up thank you
So weve been practicing adding and subtracting decimals all week last week
The new word is balance balance a bank statement
I m going to show you thats why here
This is an example of a balance sheet
When you have an account youre keeping track of the money in and out of that account
Later in this year in March we ll be going to Amara Town and youll have a checking account
Many of you see your parents use a debit card to buy things at the store
That debit card is immediately taking money out of their account and your parents can look online at their account balance and see when money comes into their account
Like they get their paycheck it probably goes directly into their account and then when they buy things and they swipe their card the money automatically comes out of their account so you can see what your balance is with all those transactions
Because you re taking money in and out of your account you need to know how much you actually have
I understand what balance means Im not sure
Were not talking about balance like in PE where you re balancing on the balanced beam right
Yes
Talk with your face partner
Partner A gets to go first
Partner A gets to go first
What does balance mean
Ready
Go
Go
All right lets hear what balance means in your words or your partner s words
Major
Balance means what you have of the total of if you re spending something or losing something or gaining something and whats the total you have right now at that moment
Nicely done
Thank you
It s really important at Amara Town that you keep track of your balance
Were going to teach you how to record it and keep track of it because they wont give you this handydandy app on your phone but look at your balance so well be practicing that later this year but this is definitely practice towards that today
Let s look at our success criteria
Read that with me
please
I will know I am successful when I can explain what strategy was most efficient to add and subtract decimals
Youll be playing a game where youre keeping track of your balance
How appropriate
Its that time of year where we are doing lots of shopping right
So youll lose a ton of money
Or you spend
Youre not losing it youre spending it
Thats different than losing it
When you buy something you get it
When I was little when you spend something
Thats your perception back when you were a kid
Yes
Funny
All right heres our math message
Math message
Solve the number story explain your strategy to a partner
One you had 146 in your piggy bank
You found 17 cents between the couch cushions how much money do you have now
When your partners are done go ahead and talk with your partners
Okay lets try another one
Math message two
You bought a vegetable tray for 1219
You paid with a 20 how much change did you get
Ive been walking around the room I saw a lot of people use either it looked like US traditional or trade first
I didnt see anybody shading on the old grids that weve been using
Why didnt we use that method
Why didnt we use that Bander
Because its not efficient
Yes its not very efficient
You dont see people just carrying around a lot of little graph papers
Move on Ill be right with you
Darnell used counting up
Yay
Can you model that for us
Yes
Where do I set
Wherever you want
Okay do I just put this under the thing
Wherever you want to show us at the same time
Me counting up is a mental strategy but I think it would be helpful for people to see it
Can I show it on the board maybe
Sure wherever you want
I like the way people turned to look at the Ms Carter
You start with the smaller ones so 1219 and then I did plus 100 and that will get you to
Do you mind if I have you to switch coloring material writing material so that people on the cheap seats in the back can see
Thank you I dont know why this thing isnt turning
That would get you to because 191 would get you to the 20s so probably to tens
Then I added 08 because that would get you to 13 because 82 is 10 so that would get you to 13 wholes
Then you need to get to 20 and 137 should lead to 20
Then you would circle the 7 on things you added
This and that and so 100807 would be bring the one down eight and seven and you add the decimal point back in so thatll be 781 I think
Would you have to write all this out
No
Like when I did this with Amber and Emma we did it mentally
We just said okay if get from 19 to 20 it would be one cent
From 20 cents to what would get us to the nearest dollar and we got 80 cents so we knew we had 81
Then we knew we were at 13 so to get from 13 to 20 was 7
We did all mentally but I loved that you showed how that worked
Mental strategies can be used
Should I erase it
No leave it
People can I dont know just glance at it I guess
Why do strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money
Youre going to talk with your face partner
Partner A gets to go first
Partner A gets to go first
Ready
Go
Go
All right everybody thats in the room
Gabriel let me go back to my original question sorry why do the strategies for adding and subtracting decimals also work for adding and subtracting money
Because it shows
Liola
I agree with their thinking but Id also like to add on that with decimals you have the whole number and then you have parts of a whole and money is also a whole number and parts of a whole
They just represent because theyre cents
Lots of people agreeing
You want to add to that please
I agree with Liola but also decimal place its actually the same thing because if you have 7325 in money it practically would be the same just not with a thousand
Parker
Sorry I didnt realize you said Bander sorry
I agree and I would also like to add on because when you write because when you say money you say 781 cents because of the decimal
Nice
Parker
Because if had to add on the whole number you can just say 781
It depends on what it is  the cents and the whole number would be the dollars
Kimberly
I want to add on to Gabriels There is a hundred cents and a dollar and theres hundredths and a whole number thats why its really similar because its still got the same
Its not like theyre 70 its still the same amount
Theyre still a hundred
What does the 20 in a penny represent
What does a penny represent
A person thats out of the room
Amber
One cent
One cent represents what though
How many of them does it take to make a dollar
A hundred
Yes and what place value is that in decimals
Hundredths
Hundredths right
Because it takes a hundred pennies
What about dimes what do they represent in this in the money system
Bander
A tenth
A tenth how many does it take to make a dollar
10 and then I had a voice saying we dont do ounces with our money system so thats not necessary all right
Today were going to play a game rather than do journal pages
Youre going to go to the games
Youre going to make sure that youre playing with a partner so change it from single to partners and youre playing
I was going to say guest
Can you guys read that
Yes
Do you want to come on the front to do it or can you see from here
We can see from here
The skill of practicing is what
Read it with me
Adding and subtracting decimals in the form of money
Lets read what the description is that were doing
Players take turns adding and subtracting money and ounce
The player with the most money left at the end of eight rounds wins the game
See here where player one will be keeping track of their money
Player two will keep track here
This looks like a little calculator for us to keep using
Lets try this out
Im pink what color are you
Red
Blue
Red is my second place color
Are you ready to spend and save
Here we go
Player one click the coin to toss it
Click the number generator to get a money amount
What number generator is this
Based on the coin toss add or subtract the money amount to find your balance
Enter your answer then click okay
Im going to do counting up so I know to get from 87 cents to 90 cents would be three cents so than that would be 590
Then I know a tenth would get me to the next whole number so 13 cents would get me to 6 and to get to a hundred from 6 would be 94
No
Yes 94 so Im going to say 94 and I think I said 13
Right thats your new balance
Player two click the coin to toss it
You can use whatever strategy you want okay
Click the number generator to get a money amount
Based on the coin toss add or subtract the money amount to find your balance
Do it on your slate then tell me
Enter your answer then click okay
When you see an addition sign that means youre adding to your account
Sometimes you get gifts in the form of cheques or a paycheque
Okay flash
Youre going to say that number for me
10515
Ive heard somebody say this One hundred and five dollars and fifteen cents does that sound right
No
Talk with your face partner
What would be wrong with the way they said that
Sebastian G what did that person do
They put and right when they said one hundred and five because they were thinking like zero before and
Yes so were kind of have some habits sometimes of saying things
Were trying to get out of that habit because we know and means decimal
So one hundred five and fifteen cents is what I saw a lot of people answer
Ready to go
Right thats your new balance
Get the hang of this
I need to keep practicing with you
All right fabulous
Youre going to play with your face partner
Joseph you and Skyler are face partners for this
Quinn why dont you play with Parker and you guys trio up
All right ready
Go
Go
Do you guys need this up
You two will be together
Which two will be together
Me and
Gabriel
What word could we use instead of less that we are
Subtracting
Subtraction
Im confused if Im subtracting
That doesnt make sense right
Because you added a seven
No nine minus seven
You didnt minus that
I cant minus zero from here
We keep saying about minus
I mean you cant subtract zero from zero
We have to go over here and subtract one to zero
Add ten right there and then subtract ten and nine
Then you get ten right there
Do you remember when you guys were like in Kindergarten and you did calendar math
They would gather the little popsicle sticks
Yes
I think this is six
No its five six seven eight nine and then Ill get 10
Now we have 10
Then we rubber band these together to make a group of 10
Do you remember that
When youre borrowing and trading or regrouping
These all mean the same thing
Youre taking this group of ten and moving it over to one place value
You didnt like Brody said you over here there was nothing to borrow
You have to change this 100
Oh right
Does that make sense
So thats a zero
There you go
Coach your partner
Coach your partner
youre working with
My turn
I need to do some mental math
Okay time out please
Thank you
Looking for a couple of more pairs of eyes
Thank you
Right now for the next 15 minutes
This is your assignment
Youre going to finish that math box work
Some of you are finished
That doesnt pertain to you
You just keep moving down this list
Page 115
Thats practicing finding area that have fractional linked sides
When you finish that you can play this game
You can either do it independently or with another person that is also finished
Questions about what to do here
All right ready go
Thank you
Something that
Thats all right you did it
this stuff
Thats better
Finished
Bianca you might want to do some fixups
Some of those math  to get a very tough you know how math boxes give you page number
Here to look at some examples
You might want to go back on the lines  and look at those journal pages and get those grades up
Can I do my math
No right now here in class
I need to get this done
Its keeping me and getting my work covered
Whichever way  Im coming you want me to  Do you have the real  Such as
You can borrow it
I dont need it
Yes
the problem
Can you coach me in my math
Do you need help
Yes
Im sorry Im not going to help you with that
Okay I get it
You were doing that so its fine already
Its fine your way thats fascinating
Cool that was awesome
Nice job guys
Youre on oneminute warning
My friends are not back at their desks if you can please get there
The math  that we did for our warmup this morning you can either give it to somebody for extra practise if they want it or you can recycle it
Thats a copy of the homework I just put in the center of your table
Please put your name on it
Except for the assignment we did for our warmup give it to somebody for extra practice if they need it or you can recycle it
Rotate to this home link that says 414
Read the directions at the top with me
For each number  write a number model with a letter for the unknown
Then solve
Show your work on the back of this paper
So are you going to write an answer into the number model
No
Youre are supposed to write a letter for the unknown
Should you put a unit with your answer
Yes
Questions about what to do at the top
And down below is except you practicing some division
Thank you
Lets put some closure on what we did today
what was an effective strategy for adding and subtracting amounts of money for you
What were the effective strategies
Not with your shoulder partner about that partner
B goes first
Ready go
Okay
Your success criteria you will know you are successful when you can explain what strategy was most efficient to add and subtract decimals
Go Quinn
Can you please answer
My partners talked about how we felt that counting up subtraction was efficient because the counting up strategy because its the most inadequate one  and it doesnt take a lot of time
With US traditional we like  to figure it out
Brody why are you using that
I think kind of because with some people its not efficient for some people because  some people do it and you still end up with a trouble process to do
Good point if you dont understand the strategy then it can be a more timeconsuming one
Can we agree that whats efficient for you might not be efficient for somebody else potentially
I know when I was a kid my mom shed always say when we were playing Monopoly Here count up to make change I never understood
She never demonstrated it to me
She would just do it so I never understood it until I was a Ms Carter and I had to make sure people knew how to do it and I could show them
How are you with the success criteria for todays math lesson
if you could teach it to somebody else it means you know what youre doing or tutor me
So Im getting better
Im not quite where I need to be
Thank you
You going to put your homework away
Make sure that
Make sure you have your Chromebook at your desk before you join us for
Thank you
