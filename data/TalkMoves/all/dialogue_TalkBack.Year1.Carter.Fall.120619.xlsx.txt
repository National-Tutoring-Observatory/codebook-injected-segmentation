The main thing that needs to come SS through from your homework last night
Think about this question they came with
They said Theres someone at my table who has their quadrilateral in a different place than mine is their answer still correct
Yes
Fine
Talk about that at your teams why could that still be correct
Okay back to me please
So please could someone have the correct answer why or why not
Even if its not the same as yours
Its because its still the same thing
If mine was reSSy big and Sammys was reSSy smSS itll still be the same thing
How is it the same thing
Theyre still the same shapes
Yes you had to draw a quadrilateral it didnt say what size it said just make a quadrilateral right
Elex
It also says plot any three points
There you go
Plot any
Thats keywords there
Thank you
I like where I see some people giving feedback
Lets go on to slate please
Its fine dont worry about it just do it
SS right I am going to be displaying a mixed number or a fraction and you record an equivalent mixed number or fraction with the same denominator on your slate so it has to have to same denominator
Flash
Looks like a lot of people are SS saying 1 12
Nicely done
Thank you
Heres your next attempt
Try 54
Flash
A lot of people saying 1 14
I see a couple of people that dont seem to have the strategy so Im going to have you talk with your shoulder partner about how to do this
Partner A explains her thinking first
Ready
Go
Back to me
Thank you
Do we need to talk about this or do we have it now
Okay here we go then
Lets try another one
Sorry I dont know if these two things are clacking together clacking on the buttons or what
Try this one
Lets make it bigger so you can actuSSy see it
113 and flash
Excellent
I see most people getting 3 23
This time with your face partner partner B talks first this time
Ready
Go
Lets see if people can implement that
Try another one
1 75
Flash
Were going to talk about your answers at the team level
Start with person number four sharing their thinking first
Ready
Go
Could people have a different answer but still be correct
What do you think
I see a lot of people agreeing
Why do you say that Brendan
I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125
It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1
Okay I like your thinking but I think I asked a different question
Could somebody have a different answer that would still be correct
Thats what Im asking because I saw some people say something like 2 25 are 125 so why could those still be the same thing
Thats what youre supposed to talk about with your partner
Thats what I talk about any time we agree to talk
Okay looks like people did talk about that
Why do people have different answers but they still be correct
Ravier
They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125
Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25
Okay people are agreeing that
What would you like to add to that Kyle
I agree with everybody but I also want to add that you could actuSSy answer that the same because you could make it a mixed number or an improper fraction
I agree with that
Thank you Matteo
They SS have to be what
Say the word in your hands
Shout it out
Equal fractions
SS right lets try one more
5 72
Now flash
Im seeing some interesting answers
Youre going to talk about these with your face partner please
Ready
Go
Okay back to me
Thank you
How well could you rearrange these using the same denominator
Chris thank you
Think for a minute why is this an important skill
How do we use this potentiSSy
How could this help us
If you have an idea stand up please
Why bother renaming improper fractions mixed numbers fractions themselves why do we rename them
Stand up turn around and talk about that with your partner teams
Great thank you
Lets hear what is the relevance of renaming these
Hannah
First I said maybe when youre baking something you could have for example cookies you could have a certain amount of flour maybe a more exact amount maybe you could I dont know convert it to a more precise expression
Pick somebody thats trying or what to communicate with you
I agree with you and I see how you did that but Id like to add on to your idea
I like your idea of if youre baking to have this measurement lets say the tool will make the baking so unique if it doesnt have that measurement
To convert it to a different measurement can be easier because of the two measurements
Like this improper fraction could be in cups or ounces like the fractions and can convert it because it would be equivalent
I couldnt disagree with what youre saying
I think somebody else does too Barun
I want to disagree because
The denominator still had to be two so youre still talking about something that had a two in the denominator so I dont see why changing that is going to change what youre measuring devices will be because youre still going to be using the half cup measuring cup in that instance
Why would you want to be able to be flexible with changing these numbers
Kaya
Wed want to be flexible changing the numbers because if you are adding or subtracting it might be easier to have in different ways
Maybe you need to visualize it if you have it as a mixed number or maybe its easier for you to visualize it as an improper fraction
You have to be able to know how to convert them so you can make it easier for yourself
I know for regrouping for subtraction sometimes you have to regroup so that you can subtract even though the number doesnt appear like it wanted to it reSSy is then you can regroup it
Okay thank you
Lets please look at todays learning intention
Is it right here
Read this with me please
On the 10th form ordered pairs graph them enter the coordinate values in context
Thats reSSy wordy so lets think about that and form ordered pairs
Give me a gesture that helps me know that you know what order the pairs will be
Yes good
Theres numbers in between parentheses
Graph them for me a gesture for that
Yes
Good plotting points and graphing them and interpret
Look down below on the left you see where it says interpret
Interpret means to make sense of something
Like sometimes people speak a different language and you get an interpreter that can help you understand their language
They can restate things in that native language to them so interpret
Coordinate values needs to make sense of something to interpret what your values are your plotted points in context
Look at with the righthand side underneath
In context means the situation in which something happens
The situation itself within that example of that situation
What do you know about context already
Think for a minute
What do you know about context
You might think context clue like that
What does that mean when you say context clues
Make sure youre thinking with your face partner
Partner with any of those friends if youre ready to go
Turn back to me
Blake what would context clue be
Say for citric acid what can you read about it and you dont know and you have to look in that sentence like around it to see what that means
A lot of people agree with his thinking
In context just means looking around what the situation means
I could form ordered pairs graph them and figure out what they mean in that situation
I dont know why we didnt just order it that way but we did it
Lets look at the success criteria
Look at the first one
Read it with me
Write ordered pairs correctly
We shouldnt say pairs
Sorry shouldnt do this at ten oclock at night
Here we go
Ordered pairs correctly
How many of you already know how you can do that
Yes weve been practicing that SS week nice job
Graph them accurately
How many of you can already do that
Excellent
Some of us are still practicing thats good to know too
Then the third bullet read that
Answer questions related to the data correctly
Youre going to be looking at your graphs that you created today and answering some questions SS right
How are these skills relevant
Why should we be able to do this
Talk with your shoulder partner
Partner B goes first
Ready
Go
Back to me
Thank you
Evy whats the relevance of this
When we are older and using graphs to structures we can make sure its precise
Some people agree but I see some people want to add to that
Pick somebody
Lexy
I agree with you Evy and Id like to add on another way that we could apply to reallife especiSSy when were older
When we were talking about like say youre meeting up with someone somewhere and you give them and they want to know how far is this from here
On a map you could come up with the coordinates
Like youre here and then youre trying to get here and you can find out how many miles or steps I think is what they cSSed it in the graphs
Great
I like your realworld connection thank you
Lets go ahead and go to the map message
Look at this
Lets see
Look at the data in the table in journal page 138
Lets turn there to see what theyre talking about please
Thank you
Look at the data table
Touch where the data table is on page 138
Show your partner
If youre showing the graph thats not a data table
There you go
Turn to the partners across from you to see if you agree with them
Thank you
So thats the data table
Lets keep looking now back at the board
Ms Arvit told her class to use the data to write ordered pairs
Sarah wrote the following ordered pairs
Thats a nine that one right there in the following line
Thats a nine yes
Do Sarahs ordered pairs model the data
Why or why not
Give me a thumbs up if youre ready to share
Thank you
Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner
Partner A goes first
Ready
Go
Okay back to me please
Thank you
What have you discussed about that
Barun
We discussed that this is not SS of the data because she didnt get it SS because it was supposed to be 17 because the coordinates on the Xaxis and then those would be on the Yaxis
A couple of pieces of their data they reversed didnt they
You always have to keep that first number for the X and the second number for the Yaxis
Nice job catching that problem that we had
I feel like this is accessible to you this first part
Writing the ordered pairs making the grid or graphing applying the points
Thats something that weve been doing already
Everybody have your work in check with your partner and then Ill come back to you to do a little work with the questions SS right
Ready
Go
I dont know what do you think
What do you think Thomas
Why
Because you can see in the track what it is
That makes sense
SS right look like as I walk around the room that most people have not finished
Im going to have somebody take their math journal under the document camera so we can doublecheck ours and give feedback back to them
Lets see who our lucky person is
Kaya
Were not working on ours were looking at what Kayas done
I did 5 1 7 3 9 5 11 7 21 8 and I had them right here do I show how I found where they are
I dont know do you guys feel like you need to see that or are youre good and you dont need to see it
Okay I noticed that you dont have a line to connect your plotted points
What do you think would that be helpful why or why not
I think that would be helpful because it might show you a pattern in between for how far apart they are
Okay so is there a straight edge at your desk there that you could use
You see how shes laying that along the edge of SS of the plotted points David
Heres another question does it make sense to extend the line past these points
Why or why not
Think time
Would it make sense to extend that line past these points
Why or why not
You can just talk with your shoulder partner about this partner A goes first
Back to me for one minute
Are we going to talk about structures right now
No
No were talking about Lilith and Noahs age at five different time in their lives so youre trying to decide does it makes sense to extend that line past there why or why not
Ready
Go
Hey back to me please
Kaya I noticed already walked up there and extended the line and if you put maybe an arrow on the end of that line it just would show what do you think would show
What would that show
Why did she put the arrows on there Eva
Its showing that that line keeps going
It keeps going its extending it but why did you decide to do that Kaya
I decided to do that because it helps you see further maybe further in time
How do you pronounce the name
Id say Lilith
Liliths age would be 14 while Noahs age would be 10
It shows you the passage of time where their age is going to be
I see a lot of people agreeing
Because theyre not always going to just be just these ages in theory theyre going to live nice long lives until their hundreds
Theyre going to keep going theyre not going to be just these ages nice job
How old was Noah when Lilith was six
Thank you lets give Kaya a round of applause
How old was Noah when Lilith was six
When you have an answer ready stand up please
Youre going to talk with your shoulder partner its partner Bs turn to go first
Ready
Go
Hey back to me please thank you
Mikel will you go up and show us how you got your answer please
Were going to see if we agree with his thinking and see his method
What I said was when Lilith was six Noah was two because if you go to the six and to the line you can see that Noahs age is going to be two because they both meet up at this area
Where the six is for the Xaxis
Yes
People are agreeing
Nicely done
I like the way you used your graph would that work for other problems do you think
Yes
Yes anything thats still on this particular grid
I wonder why youre not adding arrows did you have a reason for that
Its there there you go sorry its hard to see on there
Nice you lets give Mikel a round of applause
Lets try another one
First of SS I got the same Im so confused
SS right thank you
Lets try this one whats Noahs age when Lilith was six and a half
SS right give me a thumbs up if youre ready to share your thinking
Great youre sharing with your shoulder partners partner Bs turn to share their thinking
Make sure you not only give an answer you show how you got your answer
Ready
Go partner B
Hey back to me please
Lets see how this works Garret
Give it to Garret
You can take your partner if you want
It always feels better to have somebody with us sometimes were not as confident
I know I always liked having a partner
One question I want to ask you is is there a reason you didnt extend your line
I forgot
Okay can you guys loan him a template real quick
Can you see why were going to extend it
Because theyre growing
Theyre growing exactly
Theyre going to keep growing
In theory most of us do hopefully
Good job I like how hes being reSSy precise
SS right the floors SS yours
So Lilith is six and a half how old is Noah
Lets think of a question we could ask Garret to help him
Whats a question you could ask
Pick somebody to give you a question thatll help you
Rodie
How old was Noah when Lilith was six
What are you thinking Reese
Tell us what youre thinking
I went to six and seven I went between because she was between those I guess then suddenly I went over and I got two so Noah would be two
I see some people thinking youre right and some people thinking youre not exactly right
I thought you were trying to coach Garret on the question that was asked so were going in two directions here
Lets finish responding to Reese and then well go back to Garret and Rodies question
Pick somebody thats showing you this Reese
Annah
I dont understand how Noah could be two when he was six and six and a half I dont reSSy understand that would work
I might have said somebodys name wrong I dont know
No it has nothing to do with the name
Do you hear that we just found out that when Lilith was six that Noah was two and now youre saying Lilith is six and a half and you say Noah is still two
Does that make sense
No
Lets help Garret here Rodie tell him your question again
How old was Noah when Lilith was six
Put your finger on the six on the Xaxis and go up until it meets the line that youve drawn there so move up
Now go across to the Yaxis go there and whats the number on the edge
Two
Two do you see how to figure out Noahs age
Yes
Okay so now Lilith is six and a half so wheres six and a half
In between six and seven
There you go so follow that same process
Go up until you get to that line and then go left to the Yaxis two and a half what do you think
Emma you need to stop Garrets talking
Nice jobs
I get this Im ready to just turn me loose I need some more practice
If youre like this and your partner is like this then you join me at the table
If youre like this but your partner is like this you can work and check and coach or  but if youre both like this I want to see you up at the table so I can coach you
Barun
Then you can work and check
Youre going to do I cant read that page number 138 139 ready
Go
A round of applause for Garret and Reese
Good job
What did you learn from the feedback from Garret
I learned that
Do you see how when she was six we put our finger here and we move up to the line and then we move forward
Yes
Okay so six and a half was here we go up to here go over and its two and a half
Maybe using this might help you
Heres seven and a half and then you can turn it and go Now I see how I do it
Do you want to try another one of these before you start your work
Liliths age when Noah was one and a half
Heres Noah wheres one and a half
Good so when you put this here look at one and a half not lets turn here from this and we plot with that one
Its between five and six
So its five and a half
Do you see how you use this
Yes
Are you okay
Yes
With this
Okay is Noah ever going to reach up to Nora
No
So its a constant they stay in that same point
Its just a constant its the same thing SS right
Im not hearing people working and checking
Make sure youre working and checking please
So you guys dont have a new one
Yes
Why dont you just do a new one then everybody can have their own copy
Did you guys already do Ls
Yes
Okay
I know
Me too
There you go
Are you ready
Yes
Please do not just get up and leave
Please do not
Lets go back to our learning intentions superduper quick before you go so that we can make sure I have this information
Youre supposed to be able to form ordered pairs graph them and interpret coordinate values in context within a situation
How do you know youve made it
Write ordered pairs correctly
Show me how well you can do that
Thank you
Graph them accurately
Show me how well you can do that please
Thank you
Answer questions related to the data
Thank you
My choir friends make sure you take your casts and I dont know if you need your coats too
Probably
Take your coats and have fun
and well see you later okay
Bye
May the force be with you
Bye you guys have fun
Thank you
Do you need help carrying stuff
Okay
SS right
