All right so for heres the scoop for today so for the first half of class were going to be working on finishing 38 this is where we left off on Friday and got just a few things to show you in that and then also show you one particular skill out of 39 that we need and then well take a short break during the passing period and start the quiz afterward and it is an individual quiz
There will be no calculator but you can use your toolkit
Thats the scoop for today any questions on that
Yes its quite a scoop
Its a good scoop
Okay so this is yes
On your switch
Yes
Whats your switch
If you can show me if we could stamp off all of your toolkits then Ill be happy
My toolkit is not done
Theres still one loophole she uses so
Alright guys Im going to send you a video youre going to like
Yes
Yes all right yes
Thats the
Yes were like this
I dont
Hey would we have the reminder weekly test
Okay done with this and mine
Yes I dont know if its
The question was about the review so the review is out of the textbook and you should have access to it today online but you always have it in the book to be looking at
If you look at the book it has examples and then the problems
It refreshes your memory on how to do those problems
I did eliminate several of the problems from the review because youre not responsible for those so not every problem from the review is there but most of the problem I think its might be 32 of them or something like that
For the quiz is it just like 38 or is it like the cumulative like that
Its a wee bit cumulative so the primary emphasis is why Im factoring and solving but theres a little vocabulary stuff in there
I think its 12
Squeaky key
All right so lets refresh our memory on the sentence stems that we used last Friday and I am going to have you work in your teams with this but were not going to change our desks were going to keep the desks like this or just have you turn around in your chairs and so person number one this is your formula and so thats like Brad then Tobias you have two and then three and four
You dont have to answer them in that order so for example if person four says Im ready to go
That person can start and what you need to do as youre listening to your teammates is making sure that theyre understanding correctly all of this stuff
Now why does this become important
Its if you were asked to graph this this is part of not only your thought process but what you have to do at the end when youre looking at your graph and youre looking at the equation and going Do they match
These are some of the ideas you need to put together for graphing as well
When youre done Im going to have your team stand up that way Ill know that your team is done
Like I said it doesnt matter who starts but go through all of these recognize that like for this bullet therere two choices
Then notice that I want you to be able to explain why you came up with that answer or how you came up with it whats your strategy
Right so go ahead and turn in your groups and whoever wants to start can go ahead and get going
As F of X heads towards negative infinity F of X will decrease
So well say it moves towards negative infinity
Did you give it a go
You should try Grady
So what did you find as the degree of this
by multiplying this by this by this squared  Think about what is the degree
Were done
Oh are you guys done
stand up if youre done stand up
Ill give you guys one more minute
All right guys open your journals to page 98
All right guys page 98
Location principle
The location principle go ahead Colin tell us what it is
It acts as a polynomial function and A and B are two real numbers such that FMA is less than zero and that would be as greater than zero that F has at least one real zero between A and B
Thats a lot of math talk for something thats pretty simple were saying that in this particular case our Yvalue is greater than zero so Y is
Positive
If Y is positive that would be up here anything near this pink range is a positive Yvalue
Ive got some Bvalue and a Y this point could be anywhere in this pink area then the same thing is true over here Y is less than zero so Y is
A negative
And its anywhere in here if I have those two and its a connected polynomial I know that there is an Xintercept in between those two numbers thats as sophisticated as that gets
The wording is tough to work through but the picture makes sense hopefully
Anybody have a question on that or need to hear somebody else explain it
To summarize this segment theres one point between A and B thats where Y is zero
Yes makes  sense
Oh thats hard to see that theres a zero
All right moving a long if we were using a graphing calculator and we have a Y and a Y what would have to be true in between
Thered have to be a zero somewhere in there so that means theres an Xintercept at onepointsomething in this particular case
Again this is just more about being able to analyze graphs
Since were not using calculators on the test Im not going to spend much more time on this but you get the concept and thats all I really want to expose you to is that concept
Then the next concept is turning points all right if you look at just the brown the first statement thats there Christian oh you just took a bite
Cooper could you read number one for me please
The graph of every polynomial function of degree N has at most N1 turning points
The graph of every polynomial function of degree N if I look here whats the degree of this one
Three
What would 31 be
Two
Two
It has two
Turning points
Thats all this is saying what could the degree of this one be
Four
Four could be more than that but basically four so 41 is
Three
One two three turning points
I like this
Or local min and max this would be a local minimum and I have another local minimum
In this location I have a minimum and in this location Ive got a minimum as well so we use that term local minimum then over here we have one two three four five
Quintic
Quintic 51 one two three four turning points and the reason it says at most was because remember something like this could actually look like that
It could still be Quintic
And still be Quintic
I was going to say couldnt it actually be more than Quantic though couldnt be sextic
It could
Yes and you have the right idea that its got to be an odd number because its going in different directions
Because your sign is there based on what you have
Thats why you could have any degree
Thats the first part of these turning points of polynomial equations
Brad could you read number two for us
If a polynomial equation has N
Okay so were talking about zeros
Zeros means
Xintercept
X intercepts
I have one two three Xintercepts
I have three minus one or two turning points
So up here we were looking at the degree of the polynomial
Here Im looking at the Xintercepts the zeros the roots the solution kind of thing and so I see one two three four Xintercepts and I have one two three one less
One two three four five Xintercepts
How many turning points we have for
Those two go hand in hand because the degree determines
It also depends though where this polynomial function is
It could be that actually all my turns are up here and I only have one and thats why you see the word exactly for this particular one cause weve counted the number of Xintercept versus at most that particular number of turning points
Whats in Italics right there also becomes important
Any questions on this
Again more conceptual understanding seeing relationships of polynomial equations and graphs and well skip over these
This is one that were going to do a little bit of work on and thats something called even and odd function
Now dont confuse that with even and on degree
Were still saying even and odd but its about either the degree that weve talked a lot about or in this case even or odd functions
You got to key in on that particular word and the even or odd degree
No thats not what were talking about here
What were talking about is an even function is symmetrical about the Yaxis
In other words if I took my graph and folded it right here on the Yaxis it would lay on top of each other
Then an odd function is symmetrical about the origin
In other words if I took my curve and pinned it down right there and spun it 180 degrees it ended up laying on top of itself again
All right so two types of cemetery about the Yaxis if this is true well explain that in just a minute or about the origin if this is true
What we do mathematically notice that they both start with exactly the same thing
Were going to plug in a negative X and then were going to manipulate it and see if I end up with my original function or I end up with the opposite of the original function
If I end up with something else then its neither an odd function or an even function
So what does that look like
If you want to turn in your text or just follow along on the screen here either will find youd be in the texts at page 171
This is our first one
I remember no matter what were testing we just plug in a negative X so every place that I see an X I put a parentheses
Theres an X with the cube outside of it so thats what I do just the X but parentheses with the negative X in it
Then the parentheses with the negative X here
Then I got to do a little math
Whats negative X times negative X times negative X going to be
Its going to be negative
Cause right
Im multiplying by three times itll still be a XQ
The negative times the negative here gives me a positive 7X and then I have to rewrite this to look like that
In other words to get this to look like that Ive got to factor out the negative sign
That becomes positive inside that becomes negative so theres my F of X I actually do have when I plug in a negative X I have the negative F of X
We determined them that its an odd function and going back to this an odd function we could say is symmetrical about the origin
Again this is something that can help us in understanding what the graph should look like
If I do this type of test I know it should be symmetrical about the origin
Thats the value of this
Then we look at the next one
Again Im just going to take this
My first step is rewriting this with parentheses every time I see an X and I plug in the negative X
Now if I multiply negative X four times it ends up being positive and the negative X twice thats going to be positive
Then I have the 1
Well look at what I already have
I just ended up right back to my original function
Thats the definition of how to test for an even one and that ones going to be symmetrical about the Yaxis
Only two types of symmetry that were testing Yaxis and about the origin
Why is it called odd or even though
Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function
Thats really weird
I know and but in a certain sense thats also what we thought of with odd and even degrees too though is positive and negative
Yes
This is one where it doesnt work out in either case
I take this I plug in the negative X raise that to the third power
That will be a negative X 32
Theres no way I can factor anything out of this guy for it to look like that and so that ones not going to be symmetrical about the Yaxis or about the origin
This idea of odd and even functions there are a couple of problems in the homework of doing this process
Just make a mental note example four can walk you through that out of the textbook you need
Yes
Yes
On average it seems to be the function with odd degrees
Well they seem to be tend to be more on the neither side or the odd side at least from what I can tell
They seem to have that more capability being
Yes because we know that if I plug a negative and its all positive theyre going to be positive
Yes youre recognizing some of the patterns that go along with that
I dont really want to take time in class to practice this
Im sorry
Just the time constraints for today
This is less important than what Im about to tell you
All right
Any questions before we leave that
Again the homework does have some of that
Refer back to that example to walk through that
Were actually going to flip over then to 39
Page 101 has our essential question and Dante could you read that for me please
How can you find a time on the old model for reallife data
Hallway partner whats a polynomial model
Tell your window partner
All right so Andy what is it
Something gets modeled with a polynomial
What does it look like when I say well heres my model
What am I handing you
A graph
I could be a graph or
A table
A table or
A chart
An equation
Yes for the most part what were talking about here is actually having an equation
How can we take reallife data and create equations out of it and what were going to focus on Oh this is kind of cool so just real briefly do you remember when we found the differences in math too
We were like as X goes up by a specific amount every time and then we start to subtract make the differences between each of the Yvalues and it told us various things about the model that we were working with
It turns out that if the differences I think if you do it twice its a quadratic if it works out with the third differences are the same I forget exactly but you can go back in and lookup
Its interesting
Were not going to go there
Youre not responsible for doing this but it is an interesting pattern to see
I know Christian you like to look at patterns
I do indeed
This is the only place were going to camp and 39 is on this first example
Weve done this type of thing with quadratics before
This is a familiar skill
We just need to apply it for cubing
What happens here is youre going to be given a graph or maybe a list of points
It could be either graph or list of points and asked to come up with the equation for that
Now be careful on the test if youre asked to do that
Pay attention to your prompt as to whether or not you have to leave your final answer in a certain form
If it doesnt say this would be fine
It might say standard form in which case then you actually have to multiply all that out
Refresh your memory on how to multiply that out
Step one were going to use our Xintercepts of 4 to create the factor X4
How
Xintercept of 1 X1 intercept of 3 X3
What is this for this A value
Window partner
Explain what that A is all about
Window partner go
Slow
Does my red polynomial have the same Xintercept
Would that be imaginary
Or what if it looked like that
Would that have the same Xintercepts
Yes
Yes but its a much  function
What makes the difference
The A
The A right
Thats why we have to know how are these Xintercepts in a sense being modified to come up with that specific graph
Yes
Yes
When you multiply into standard form do you multiply the set of intercepts by themselves in that A value or do you distribute it or
If I asked you to do that tell me how to do it
Just go across then okay
You pick two and multiply them
Ill just pick those two and multiply and I get an answer
Then I multiply by the next guy
Whats the answer to this going to be or do I do 2x3 and get six and 2x4 and get eight and multiply that together to get 48
Multiply with the 1 2 by the X4 and move that to X times the X1
Right
It doesnt matter right because 2x3x4 is the same thing as 3x2x4 so it doesnt matter what order you go in
You might look at a couple of these and what if this was X4 and X4
Well thats the difference of two squares
I can easily combine that
You might look to see which ones make more sense
I wouldnt want to multiply the 1 2 times an odd number probably
Okay so just multiply them all basically
Yes multiply them all
We have the setup with this and then we have to find another X Y point to plug in there
Well either be given one or I can look on the graph and go you know what that is crossing right there and I can put that point in or Im told the point as an extra point
I cant put in one of the Xintercepts because Ive already accounted for those here
It has to be a different point other than the Xintercepts
We can plug in the X and the Y
Of course if we have the Yintercept really nice we can plug in zero for X makes that calculation a whole lot easier
We go down and we end up finding A and then dont forget before youre done that you actually plug that A value in and specify that as your last step
How do you check
You use all of that stuff we just talked about
Youll look at this youll look at that
Does it all make sense
Thats your sanity check on it
For the rest of this period Im going to have you work on these first four problems to practice coming up with the cubic equations finding the A value all that sort of stuff
Lets see
The bell for this is at 1007
Youve got 12 minutes to work on that four problems
Can you do it in three minutes each
Give it a shot
See if you can do it in three minutes
Im going to have you stop working on that one
Now go back to this one and see if you can figure out how to start
If it is in parentheses I get three and then do I subtract it over or do I divide it over
Well what are we doing with all of those
We said its equal to zero
Well actually you said its equal to three
so then do I subtract this over here
Well what are we doing with all of these things here
We adding subtracting multiplying or dividing
Multiplying
Multiplying so multiply them all together and what do you get
3 times A is 3
So then write equals 3A
Then 3 on the left side just to
So now what are the 3 and the A doing
Are adding subtracting multiplying or dividing
They are multiplying
So  equals X
Exactly
So you divide both sides by 3
Then Ill have to write out the whole thing
Yes
Yes
Do we have to do exercises 5 through 8
No
What on the graph tells me something is squared
Its when it does what
so which one of those factors gets squared
X1
Thats where it bounces
See it bounces there
That factor is X1
Andy a little selfdiscipline never hurts anybody
Andy I think you have some work
You are not staying on the right page over here
So heres a template
The reason I wrote this twice  I can go ahead and just plug in the Xintercepts
If its supposed to be a cubic one of those two has to be a repeated one
I got to put a square on one of those
Because my template was X1
This is where its bouncing so my X1 is the one thats going to be squared
Look at what I have
Now the extra point is already here
Thats the X so I am going to put a 2 in there
Heres my steps
My first step was just to plug in the Xintercept my second step plugging in the point there
Hopefuly that help give a template that you can always use to start the process
So theres my template I have two Xintercepts
Now what are my two Xintercepts
1 and 1
One of these is going to have to be squred because theres a cubic  Which of those Xintercepts
What happens at 1 thats different than 1
All right guys this is the time to take a little bit of a break to get up walk around if you need to throw up awater bottle
When the bell rings were going to start the quiz
All right guys were going to split up the desks into rows
Lets just make it easy for your teams and have you just go to those desks
Neil just go the behind Cody then you can go to the last desk up there
Are we allowed to use the books too
Lets say that you can do that
Brad just asked about being able to use the old quiz in addition to your toolkit lets say you can do that
You can use this and just the toolkit but no calculators and yes no textbooks
You can put your textbook and journal away
Toolkits the practice quiz as it turned out to be no calculators phones need to be off and off of you
Theyre not in your pocket
Theyre in your backpack
You guys need to split
You guys should be
Toolkits and the quiz you could use those
Actually you can turn off the microphones and bring them back up to my desk
Hold down the little power button
I am going to have you sit in this desk
You put that away
Take all the other stuff out it then
Thank you
Youre welcome
You want to take it
Yes sure
There you go
Everybody has got a test
A quiz rather
Lets go ahead and write the time at the top of your paper
Right now its 1016
You got 12 problems here
What youre going to do is figure out okay how long does it take me to do 12 problems knowing that on Wednesday theres 20 multiple choice
You get an idea are you ready Are you pretty good today for the multiplechoice on Wednesday or youre going to have to get a little sharper so you can go a little faster
A chance to check out how quickly can you get stuff done
