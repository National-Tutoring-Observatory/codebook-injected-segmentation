All right in math today we are going to have a constructive responseIf you remember the last time that we did a constructive response what were some of the things that some of you needed to add to make it to show that you understand how to do a constructive response
Who remembers some of the things
Lucas
Lucas
My memorys failing me
Just to remind me this is math
Yes its math
Its a prompt where theyre asking you to solve a question solve a problem and then youre writing
Like math and writing  together
Yes
Charloette
You need to restate the question and sort out the problem
Its raised but  I guess
Thanks because we dont have evidence necessarily
Yes we dont really need it
Okay so restate answer and explain
Hey what else did we say that would be important to add into a constructive response
Sometimes the brakes or the bolts
Transitions
Okay transitions
Remember we had transition words
You can have not a hoop but a
I dont know but we definitely had transition
Do you remember that
Told us how to go through
We had detail but I shouldnt say  detail
Okay details and in those details does anybody remember what kind of vocabulary that we talked about
Charloette shes remembering
Not words
Subtraction
Subtraction
You want to remember your math vocabulary
In this one were going to look at the questions here in a minute before I have you start working on it
Im going to have you look at it with me but I want to think about what math vocabulary is going to help us that we can include in this answer
All right
On your desk you have folders with the problems and so you can look in the folder
Some are goldenrods some are whites
Its the Ameliae problem and then Im going to have you talk as a team about some of the vocabulary before I have you report out
Thank you Amelia
Shes getting hers passed out so everybody can look at it with me
Its getting passed out so everybody in the team can look at it while I read it
Okay everybody has one in front of them
All right so it says a baker has 35 pounds of sugar to split equally amongst 6 containers
How much sugar will go into each container
His containers only hold six pounds
Will the containers be able to hold the sugar
Wait what did you say we had to discuss
Youre finding out some math vocabulary that would be good for this specific problem
Okay go ahead and talk as a team
Okay Mason whats one of the words that your team came up with
Division
This problem theres going to be some division so we may want to use the math term division
All right
Shes not in
Lucas
Lucas
My team we thought up several
The word several
Several of or how many more
Okay Amelia
Oh come on
How many more
How many more
It never picks me and now it just
Randomly does
Yes
I know
It never picks me
How many more
How many more
Yes it must like your team today
Thanks
Im going to pick from a different team
Oh my God
What did it pick
Everlyne
Oh my God I called it
Okay Harper
What did your team say
Multiply
Maybe there might have something to do with multiplication
Sometimes when you divide you can check your work by doing the opposite operation
This is amazing
Charloette what did your team say
I think we said something up here
Yes split equally and I also have one as well
One remainder  out of this and what did we do with the remainder
Okay
Remainder
Im not saying that there is
Anybody else
There is something that their team said that you feel needs to be up here
Evelyn
Subtraction
There may be a fraction as the remainder
What are some words that go with fraction
Amelia
Numerator and denominator
Numerator
Denominator
Add subtract
No one said add or subtract yet
Add subtract multiply
We have split equally
Do you want equally
Any other math vocabulary
No wait
No
In your response we have three things
We have where were going to show our work our actual answer and then heres your explanation
Were going to use this math vocabulary
Maybe youre not going to use every one of these words youre going to choose what makes the most sense but this is your success criteria
When you go through your learning target is I can answer a problem by showing my work answering it and explaining my work
Thats your learning target
Your success criteria is did I restate the question
Check
Did I put my answer in the explanation
Check
Did I explain how I got the answer by using transitions details and math vocabulary
Even though I dont have the slide for the learning target and the success criteria its right here
Im going to leave this up
These words are reminders for your math vocabulary
While you work on this on your ownthe voice level is zero on your ownyou may have your snack and you may work on this
Were not spending all morning doing this but this is your ticket to lunch
This has to be done
Any questions that you have before you start working on this on your own
Lucas
Lucas
Can we work with a teammate
No this is to tell me does Lucas understand this
Not does Lucas and Amelia and Leah and Brooklyn and Everlyne understand this
Its do you understand this on your own
We did a little bit of the footwork together
Is this  to those who get done
Well that should have already been done
I know Im getting it done but it takes forever
because youre the smart one
Thats the only problem
Evelyn has a question
If you want the answer in simplest form or
Evelyn had a question
Do you want the answer in simplest form or the answer that you get
You can do it in either way
Remember in fifth grade we dont have to necessarily have stuff in simplest form
If you know how to do it thats probably what I would do
If you dont thats okay
All right
Any other questions
Okay Im going to set a timer on my phone because if I set a timer the words were hard to see
Ill just set the timer on my phone
All right it will be 13 minutes
You wont be mad if we just try
I got about eight and a half minutes left
Hey a little bit less than four minutes left
If youre done raise your hand and Ill come pick it up
Okay the timer just went off
Some of you are still working on it
I just want to
Okay you give that to me
Im almost done explaining
Did anybody when they did this did they write the number of sentence
Yes
Raise your hand if you wrote a number or sentence
I think I did
Thats what I meant you did okay
Did anybody draw a picture
Yes
Did anybody use another Excuse me
Did anybody use another strategy
Amelia
Yes
Did you use another strategy
Yes
Okay what was it
Dont explain everything you did just tell us the strategy
I did several number sentences and I drew a picture of some circles
I equally split them and I said what the first answer I got and then I used the picture to help me and I got my final answer
Okay all right anybody else
No one else seriously
Show me
I used the division thing that I
Okay and is that long division traditional division
Is it partial quotients
I think it was traditional division
I just knew the answer
I will be looking at these but how did you feel on this
Thumb up in the middle thumbs down
I was in between in the middle and thumbs up
Okay
I feel great
In between good and in between the middle
Okay well Im excited to see your explanations to see if theyre better from last time
Or worse
No I hope theyre not worse
What we are doing the beginning of the year middle
