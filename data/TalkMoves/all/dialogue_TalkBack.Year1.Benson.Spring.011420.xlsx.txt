All right you ready
Close up your journal for now
Testing testing
One two three
All right problem
The first problem the pink problem
Julie will you read that out loud for me please
Diana has five beets Kennedy has seven times as many beets as Diana
How many beets does Kennedy have
What do we need to find out
Leo what do we need to find out
How many beets Kennedy has
What do we know
What pieces do we know
Quinn
That Diana has five beets and Kennedy has seven times that
How are we going to write a number sentence to show us how to solve that go ahead Kenzie
5 times 7
How many does Kennedy have
So five represents whose beets
Seven represents
Kennedy
No the multiple
The number of times more beets
What does 35 represent
Kennedys
All right
Carson will you read the green problem for us please
Ellie has a small ball made of 20 feet of string a large ball of string has 30 times as many feet of string
How many feet of string is in the large one
What do we need to find out Mason
We need to find out what 20 times 30 is
We need to find out what 20 times 30 is how do you know that
Because it says 30 so theres 20 feet of string and a large ball of string has 30 times as many
So those clue words helped you figure out what you needed to do okay
Mason says we need to do 20 times 30
What does the 20 represent Emery
Ellies
Ellies is it necessarily important that Ellie owns that or are we talking about different sizes
Different sizes
At first I was like Well who has the bigger ball of string
It doesnt matter who has it were talking about the size of the ball of string
Ellies is what size
20 feet
The smaller one which is 20 feet
A larger one has 30 feet
No 30 times as
30 times
Mason I agree with you that you would do 20 times 30
Anyone add 30
No
No
Awesome
What is our answer there
600
600 represents what
The larger ball of string
More specific please
30 times
30 times as many as the small ball of string
600 represents you said the ball of string
The larger
600 ball of string
The larger ball of string
Whats our unit of measure
What are we measuring with
Feet
Feet in the
Large ball
Thank you 600 feet in the larger ball of string
This one was a little more tricky because it put it in a different order for you it didnt give you the problem to start with it gave you the total to start with
Matthew oh sorry Im going to have someone else read it
Levi would you be willing to read the blue problem
Matthew and his older brother Jason were eating grapes
Jason ate 54 grapes which is 9 times as many as Matthew
How many did Matthew eat
We know how much Jason ate and that that number is nine times many as Matthew
Evan talk me through that
All you have to do is you have to find out how much Matthew ate and how you do that is you do 9 times something equals 54
So our unknown is how many Matthew ate because it tells us how much Jason ate and that that is equal to nine times something
Did anyone do it in a different order
Bryson how did you do yours
549
You did a division problem
You just worked it backwards we know the opposite function of multiplication is division which is basically saying this what number times 9 will give me 54
If you know your multiplication facts you know that 6 times 9 equals 54
So how many did Matthew eat
Six
Six what
Grapes
Next part
Ratica ate 13 of a small peach tart did anyone draw pictures for this
Nobody drew pictures to help them view it
Okay
For me its much easier to draw pictures remember that 13 looks like a peace sign when we do it as a circle
If Ratica ate 13 of a peach tart and Brianna ate 13 of another peach tart with the same size I need to draw another peach tart and Brianna ate 13
How much did the girls eat together
Two
Miles what did you say
I thought the girls ate together was 23 because the bottom numbers stay the same but you add the two top numbers
So you said that together they ate 23 because each of them ate Participate with me please come on
Each of them ate 13 so you added them together
Can anyone else explain that in a different way
Mason
I also  they ate together so it says that Brianna ate 13 of another peach tart so its 2 peach tarts in total
What they did is they ate one of the 13 from one and then they ate another 13 from another so 23
You did the same math basically but thought of it as 13 of one peach tart and 13 of another peach tart
Did anyone happen to view 26 as their answer
Okay if you did 26 I want you to think about that for a minute
What does the bottom number of a fraction mean
Liam
What the whole is
What the whole is So you think that the bottom number shows you how many are in the whole
It shows you how many
Okay add on to that or help clarify that a little bit Wes
How many pieces there are
How many pieces there are total in that whole thing thats being split up
Our bottom number should tell us how many total pieces there are in the whole
Leo I have a question for you
What
Were there six pieces in the whole
How do we know there werent six pieces in the whole
Because they ate what
13
13 that bottom number tells us how many total pieces there are in the whole
This is Raticas whole this is Briannas whole there were two separate wholes that we were talking about but Ratica ate her part of her whole Brianna ate her part of her whole but together they ate this much
We have to ask ourselves how many total pieces were there in the whole
Raticas had three Briannas had three
Thats why we dont switch it to become six does that makes sense to you
Declan does that make sense to you
Okay
I have another question wait a second
I have another question
Lets pretend that Briannas tart is much larger
Raticas tart is about as big as your hands you can go it together in a circle and lets say that Briannas tart is as big as your arms can go in a circle
Yes
The hands versus arms
What the total amount of what they ate
Would our answers still be the same if they ate 23
I would give the one for you like
Brandon I see you shaking your head how come
Because if theyre human size you cant compete with them because the
Okay
If I said a 14 of my class is going on a field trip and then we compare that to 14 of a class that has 10 kids would it be the same number of kids going on a field trip
No
No
No
Our wholes have to be the same if were going to compare them like that okay
Nice job explaining that
All right lets look at our math Journal pages come on come one
It is page 159
What page
These are those numbers  but we have to really accurately read to help us understand
Were just going to cut and break down what each problem says then you guys work on fully
For number one Michael will you read us the problem for number one
Yes
Okay were going to visualize Ryan and his three sisters how many people are working
Four
Four people because its Ryan and his three sisters
Four people are working
They are working to paint
Ryan has his bucket of paint and he is going to use how much of his paint
23
23 each so theres one of their problem the 23 then each of his sisters so theres three more people
Theyre each going to use 13 of their cans
These cans are all the same size so we know were not comparing cans to cans
Were trying to figure out how much they used altogether
What is the whole thing that were working with
What are we breaking into whole Declan
Well the whole thing is cut into third but what is the third Leo
A can of paint
A can of paint okay so your whole is a can of paint
You have room to draw if you want to you have room to just write number models if you want to
Can you please talk through how we know what were going to put in our number model
What are we going to add together in our number model
Xander what things do you think you are going to add in your number model
I think Im going to add 23  13  13  13
All right can you please tell me what 23 represents
How much paint he used
Okay thats Ryans can of paint that he used
He used 23 of it and what is each of these 13 represents
How much his sisters used
Sister one sister two and sister three thank you
Is your number going to be an improper fraction
What does an improper fraction mean Esther
Its  over the whole but its more
Its more than a whole right
Our top number our numerator will be larger than our denominator which means thats more than one whole
Like 65
Feel free to draw feel free to figure out both in improper fraction and mixed number fraction if you want to
Everyone understand how to get to where you need to be on that one
Yes
Because Im going to erase that
Are you good
Yes
All right let me just get this for our problem number two
This persons name is Charice Emery would you please read that aloud to us
Her name is Charice
Ally and Charice both want to stay in shape
On Saturday Ally ran 38 of a mile more than Charice Charice ran 78 of a mile
How far has Ally run
Okay we need to really dissect what we know
How far did Charice ran
78
78 right
Charice ran 78 of a mile
What do we have to find out
We needed to find out how much Ally ran right Eric
Yes
How do we find that out
What information did they give us Felicity to help us figure that out
Ally and Charice both run to stay shape
On Saturday Ally ran 38 and
Read that carefully students
Just recreate she ran 38
of a mile more than Charice
Okay we know how far has Charice ran we know that Ally ran 38 more than her
Will we be adding or subtracting
Subtracting
Adding
Who said adding at that table
Me and
Eric why are we going to add onto this
It says more and if you say less then were going to be subtracting it
Number story problems they give you those clue words
A lot of times it asks you how many more and thats when we subtract but this ones telling that we know this and then this person ran much farther or that much more of a fraction of a mile
A lot of times when we hear more we do subtraction and in this case Eric you and whoever else in your table I heard a couple of people say Youre going to add we would be adding that on to okay
What is the whole thing that were counting
Miles
What Lila
Miles
Miles
A mile
One mile is the whole
Theyre breaking that mile into parts
You feel like you can figure that one out now without me even writing the number model for you Beckett
No
We have to
Okay
Ill now let you guys do it
Once you guys are done working on your problems then well come back together and talk about them
Make sure that when you answer it you tell that youre focusing on what your measurement is
Down at the bottom you have some fractions that youre adding together
They look really different than something weve ever seen before
All right the denominators of all of those the things
Yes
Do I add the denominators together
No
Anyone know why we dont add the denominators together
going up
Mason why dont we add the denominators together
Because then we would add two wholes
Yes were just talking about if this part is cut into this many pieces and we are talking about this many of them and another whole is cut into this many pieces and were only talking about How many total parts of the whole would we be adding together
We dont then cut it into that many more pieces does that make sense
Remember that our denominators is how many total pieces the whole is cut into
Down here we have something cut into 10 equal parts were going to focus on two of them
That whole is still cut into 10 equal parts and were going to add 5 more pieces to it
Think about your pie at Thanksgiving time way back three months ago
Lets say that it was cut into 10 equal pieces
On Thanksgiving you ate 2 of them and the day after Thanksgiving you ate 5 more of them
The pie pieces didnt change shape they were still 10 pieces you ate 2 of them one day and 5 another so you still have out of those 10
Same thing here same thing here
You have this page to work on and decimal review on the next page
We still have
Oh thank you I forgot I used my marker on it instead of pencil thank you
You have decimal review so youre going to think about these are tenths these are hundreds there goes my cage coloring in your grid to match these are tenths
Look back at your place value chart place the following decimals on the number line you need to place 82100 and 29100 write each decimal as a fraction each of those two
Write them in words use your place value chart for that
Remember you say a whole number then you say What word do you say with a decimal
When you see a decimal you say
And
And
All right Im going to let you work together lets come back together in 30 minutes to go over the two fraction problems review our decimal
If you have time to do math boxes that would be fabulous if you are done with all of that you may play math games and Ill let you pick what you want
No because were going to come back together I dont want to worry about getting it off the way
Whyd you get these numbers for
No were playing math games  and youre done with all three of those tables
Yes
Do you need this
need to calm down
If you were not done with page 60 at 800 or 920 youll stay through recess to get it done
also need to get done
30 minutes to recess I cant wait
in 20 minutes
What are you doing
Were doing multiplication  because thats not enough time  multiplication facts
Okay
If there is a microphone near you where you were working
We got ours
Put it on now
Wait
We have one
Okay
In problem number one were on the  problems page
All of you need to have your math journal out so that you can help describe and explain and justify what you did the math
Max what was the whole thing that we were trying to talk about when we are talking about our fractions with the whole
A can of paint right
Just one can of paint  thats what were splitting into parts
All right so we had said Ryan used 23 each of his sisters and there were three of them used a 13 and that was a total amount of paint that they used okay
Dilly and I drew a picture so Dilly will you describe never mind dont describe since I did it with you
Anyone else draw pictures
Quinn describe to me what you drew to help you solve this problem
Okay so there were four cans of paint
So we put them all in 23 and the first one which I believe two of
Thats Ryan
The second and the rest
Okay so this would be sister one sister two sister three
Are we adding together whole things
Are we adding together whole cans of paint
How many whole cans of paint did they use
Declan
One
I asked you a yes or no question
Are we adding together whole cans of paint
Yes
Is that were counting at
No no
Where are we counting at
Part of paint
How many parts of paint where we cut it into
Thirds
We cut it into thirds
Were adding up thirds
Thats how they split each of their cans of paint
Cut them into three equal parts
We are adding up thirds so the easiest way to do this is to start counting by thirds
Count with me
13 23 33 43 53
Right now we know 53 of cans of paint were used
Where we add together Ryan his first sister his second sister and his third sister
They together used 53 cans of paint
How many thirds does it take to make a whole can of paint
Three
Three of them
If I take three of those thirds and combine it all into one how many thirds is still being in this problem Declan
We still have 23
Yes
Yes
These two things are equal
53 is the improper fraction way of writing it
1 23 is the mixed number
You know that 33 makes one full can of paint
Four five theres two more thirds left
Makes sense
Yes
Did everyone get that answer in our problem
Yes
Okay
Lets switch to problem two
All right we decided one mile was a whole
Dilly and I drew a number line to help us with this we drew out miles
If this is zero mile this is one mile this is two miles what should each mile be split into
What fraction
How many parts
One person knows
Maria how many parts should we cut our miles into
How many equal parts
Eight
Eight okay
Theres eight there
An eight there
Why do we cut them into eight equal parts
How do you know that Julie
Because eight is the common parts in mile
Okay
Does this tell us right here
Yes
That bottom number shows us how parts of whole is cut into
Our denominator tells us that we dont even have to try that figure it out
Caden how far did Charice ran
78
78
18 28 38 48 58 68 78
This is where Charice ran
How much farther than Charice did Ally ran Xander
She ran 38 farther
Yes
If I start at Charice I need to go how many more eighths
Three
One two three
This is where Ally ran
I need to figure out what that fraction is okay
I ran or Charice ran 78 Allys going to add on 38 to her distance we need to figure out how far that is
When Dilly and I worked this problem we literally just counted eighths
We went 18 28 38 48 58 68 78 88 98 108 or you could pay attention to the whole number
This was one whole mile and there were two more eights after that so she ran one whole mile and 28 of the next mile
Did she run more than a mile or less than a mile
More
How did you solve that problem Brandon
Did you use something different
No
You drew a number line like that
Well I sort of thought the same thing but I actually did all
Youre on your decimal page no wonder why youre confused
Can you switch to the fraction page
Where did you do to figure out how far Ally ran
I did it up by doing three  by adding the top numbers because you cant add the bottom number with 10 so
So you just did the actual number model problem instead of drawing a picture
Did anyone else draw a picture
Nobody drew square or circles cut into tenths
That tells me that youre remembering the rules of when denominators are the same you may add the numerators
As Im walking around all of you did that all of just did the number model I dont see any pictures
Any questions on that
Declan you have question
Not a question but I guess  if you added the numerators if you wanted 216 would that be
Yes
Okay and the bottom ones are pretty simple right
Yes
Okay all right turn to the next page
