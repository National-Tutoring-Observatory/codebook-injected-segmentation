Okay lets get started
If you wrote a decimal for 210 raise your hand
Ally what did you write
I wrote zero
Is it okay to write this
Yes
Is it okay to write this
No
Is it okay to write this
No
Yes as long as zeros keep going after it its okay
Basically you would just be creating an equivalent fraction
Were over here
If you multiplied 210 times 1000 over 1000 you would have 2000 over 10000
That would be represented with your zeros on the decimal
All right if you did 710 as a decimal show me your hands
Austin what did you write
I wrote zero and seven
What place is that zero and seven
Tenths
Tenths you got it
How many of you wrote a fraction for zero and 310
Brian what did you write
310
If you did 34 hundredths as a decimal raise your hand
Nate what did you write
I wrote zero and 34 hundredths
You got it
Would you please write
Why are you are not writing
Thank you
If you did 80 100 as a decimal what do you write
Show me your hand
What do you write
Show me your hand
Just raise it up
hi whatd you write
I wrote 0 and 8 80100
Make sure you say that
Whats this word
And
And
There you go
Can I leave it like that
No
yes
If you say yes you can why can I
Why can I write 08 for 80100
Why can we do that Tom
Because its whole  is not like 3400 where it has another
Can you explain that to me in a different way
Im not understanding that
It basically has this  whole number and its not
Thats a whole number
Not a whole number but basically I dont know how to explain it but basically
Are you saying yes I can write it that way
Yes
Think about what is that
Read that to me as a number
Thatd be zero and 810
Youre telling me 810 is the same thing as at 80100
Do you agree
Yes
How many of you agree with that 810 is the same thing as 80100
Then I should assume its okay to write this fraction as this decimal or I should add a zero on to it
Either way its the same thing
Did anyone do the fraction for 0 and 63100
Cameron what did you write
63100
Is there any other way to write that
Yes
No
is trying to draw my desk
Yes were done
Were done
Were not having any more of this today
Stopnow
Were not having any more of it today
I am right here
Your attention should be here
Should not even be near Black
How many of you did this as a decimal the challenge one
So many of you are not raising your hands
How come youre not raising your hands
If you did it you need to raise your hand
Be brave
Cole what did you write for five 5100
Zero and
Will you tell me literally whats write zero point
Thank you
Do you agree with Cole
Yes
Anyone disagree with Cole
No
I agree with you too
Remember that when we have 5100 this is the tenths
Do we have any tenths when theres five
8
Thank you sir
Do you agree with Zach
Yes
Anyone disagree
Then nine hundredths as a fraction Rob
Nine over this
Over what
Thank you
You guys have gotten really good at those
I feel like youre really comprehending tenths and hundredths pretty well
You feel confident with it
All right Im going to switch colors
Can you please give me some information on how you solved  Sophia what were you thinking
You had your zeros in there
Anyone do it differently or have something to add on to what Sophia said
No
Anyone disagree with Sophia or how she solved that problem
Who did it differently
Hannah what did you do
Instead of changing the 450 to 45 I left at 450
You left it at that
Since yesterday when we did those multiplication problems because  zero
Keep that in there on the other side of the equal sign
Did you write it
Did you actually write an equation
Or did you just think it through
I did write
What did you write as your equation
9 g450
You knew the basic fact of 9 5 is 45
You took g to equal 50
Is that what Im understanding
Yes
Did anyone do it differently
Anyone write a division problem
Ally
I did the house and I did 450 divided by 9 equals 50
All right
Do you see that
Not many people are familiar with that little symbol we call it the house
I call it the house
Its not really called house
Its called the division symbol
When my sister and I were growing up thats what we used
That was it
Thats how we learned division
We have this little symbol here or this little symbol here
There was no symbol of the slash
We learned later fractions and division are very similar but we didnt do problems that looked like that
Ally you knew you had to figure out 9 times something would give you 450
What did you think of
I thought of basic fact
You thought of your basic fact
Can I ask you a question
Where did you write your 50
On my  house
Did you put your five above the four above the five or above the zero
Above the five
You put it above the five
Do you know why you did that
Because that
Youre still going to think of numbers in their place values when you use this symbol
Its really interesting to think about this symbol
How many 9s are in 45
There are five of them but were not talking about 45 are we
What number are we dividing
450 so there actually 50 9s in 450
This is your tense column
You would want to put your 5 because its worth 5 10s above the tens column
Well get to that when we start doing big division
Its coming soon
Are you so excited
Yes
Super excited
Think how smart youre going to be
All right Im going to put up a blank page real quick and were going to do two practice problems before you start
When do we start
I need a  sheet
Hold on
The area of that rectangle is 200 square feet
The length of this side is 50 feet
If you would like to draw this on your board youre welcome to but your attention needs to be on the problem that were working on together
I have questions for you that are specific
What does area
mean
Jaden what does area mean
The inside of the rectangle
Yes the surface area inside the rectangle all this space in here
Youre absolutely right
Youre right its inside the shape
Weve only really learned the area of rectangles
For us were going to focus on squares and rectangles
How do I know the opposite sides measurement
If I know this side was 50 how do I know the measurement of this side
Jaden
The measurement of that side is  its 50 because the top side 50 and the bottom side has to be 50
Can we assume a rule that opposite sides of rectangles are equal
Yes
Thats a rule of a rectangle a property of a rectangle
Whatever I find over here should be the same thing over there right
Give me a problem an equation that I could write to help me solve the missing side
Theo give me an equation I can use
You could use
Do you want me to write the formula up there for area to help you remember
you could have a equals
You just use this part and this part what parts missing
There you go
Basically Theo we just wrote it in reverse
We did area equals the length times the width
Remember when we multiply its okay if we do that
Kennedy what should I be thinking of as my basic fact
Sorry I got you with  in your mouth
Do you want me to come back to you
Charlie what is should I be thinking of as my basic fact
Five
Five times something gives me
Basic fact
Were going to pretend thats not there were going to pretend
20 Yes
5 times something gives me 20
What is it
Four
Four my missing link is four
Does that make sense to you all now that youre seeing it over and over
Yes
Okay Fletcher
Do you  like if you dont know about the 4  there is one 50 and another 50
Are these worth 50
Is this worth 50
No
The top
Oh
So if you have a 50 on the top  50 times 4 is equals 200
That might work with this one
Would that work with a different measurement
Lets look and see
Im going to change the measurements and see if that works for you
Lets say that this is 250 and thats 50
Could you do 5 50s and make sure 50
Yes
Would that work
so what you do you take a 50 and then
Can you come show me on there
Remember that if you put your hand on it its going to write where hand is
Just use the
and you can stand on one of those if you need to
Pardon me Ally
You have to  and then you put one right here
Oh I see what you mean
Youre having four
Thats because two times four is
Then if we did that over here and did five them
One two three four five
50 50 50 50 50
Yes
Thats an interesting way to think of it
I havent thought of it like that before
Thank you
Oops didnt have it
Are you ready to try it on your own
Yes
Do we want one more practice
No
Youre ready
page number 193
Oh 193
Everybody there
Problems one and two are exactly like what weve just been doing
Im going to skip past those because you get a visual rectangle to help you see what part is missing
Were going to look down at part three
Can you scoot your finger down and look at number three
Your pencil should not be writing right now
You have a table given to you and youre going to have this on your homework as well
Youll have some pictures of rectangles and youre going to have a table
Number three says the
library has rectangular tables in many sizes
Using the information given youre going to complete the chart
Sometimes youre going to get the length of one side but not the other side and youll get the area or youll get not this side but youll get this side and youll get the area
These are basic facts
Super simple
If you think of it as this number times this number equals your area youre doing area equals width time length
See them
Youre just doing the problems in the reverse order of what we say
You need to figure out what times 8 would give you 24
What times 6 would give you 48
What times 100 would give you 400
That is a huge table
Then you have a couple of story problems
When we were doing write a decimal for a fraction or a fraction for a decimal is that what youre talking about
No no
When we did the area of 450 and one side was 9
Area of
The new one that I just drew 250
Youre asking me what now
Would
Yes lets redraw and see if that works
Okay lets look at it
We have 250
Youre asking if I did 200 divided by 50
No
100 divided
Why 100
Because then you could split this in half
Lets see if that would work
Then if you double that
Youre starting youre thinking of whats coming
Remember we talked about quotients
Were going to be able to do partial quotients where we do part of a problem and another part of a problem to break them down and make them easier
Yes you could but thats coming soon to a theatre  Very cool
Good thinking
Excuse me
I need to know Oh you mean for whats coming
I bet you would if you were less focused on what Black was doing
You havent even tried working with a partner yet
Your job is to try working with a partner and see if your partner can help talk through something with you
If not then Im happy to meet with you at  Im right now really disappointed because we just did all of that and your focus was nowhere where its supposed to be
Yes you can move them
What are you conflict about
What dont you get Kennedy thats a big overall statement
What dont you get
I need to
Okay what are we working on
Area
Area
What is area
The middle part of the
Normally were given these two and we have to find that out
They usually give us length to  and we have to find that
Now they gave us area
Instead of doing  equals  We will do this times this
No
Were going to do this one first
Theyre giving us this
Were going to   Were replacing the  Were starting  20
Kennedy No not eight
Thats not the answer
Not that one
Were going to put equal here
Lets just do the next one
No I did it
Theres two equal
Oh
All we have to do is   one down
Youll have to figure 9 times what is going to give you
Wait no
Start with 400
They gave you the area
They gave you the width   Just replace
1400 divided by two
700 divided by two
come down here let me catch up with you
No wait
No
Lets start with 400
Here stop
200 and then 500  then it would be
