Welcome back
Are you safe
Yes I am fine now
We have a church and so we videotape the stuff and so I might use it for that and so I was kind of attracted to getting the swivel just as much as iPad and Ive never had a tablet because my phone does anything I  a laptop
Yes pretty really thats all you really need
I think with traveling if I need something a little more convenient than trying to answer email on a phone
All right guys lets have a seat please
If you can turn your desks for our team time
Brittany zack and Chase your tests are here
Sorry I didnt get them
We passed him back before
Here you go
All right our team numbers
Team one is closest to the door two three then it comes back up here four five six seven and eight
What do you see
What teams get to pick up our microphone
Team three
Team seven
Its you guys
Are they ready
Team five
Thats right in the middle
Okay team four
If you would please be very cautious with the microphones so that they dont get broken or dropped or anything like that because theyre just a wee bit expensive
It looks like were recording
Liz what do you think
Are we recording over there
What do you think Liz
We have success
Thank you for turning those on
Will you turn the light on back there too
This was the Makeup quiz so if you didnt like your score on the online quiz you could do the one in the books so if youve done that just put it in the basket
I wanted to put these up here again just in case
You might have actually thought of a question between yesterday and today about any of this
So any question about our tests thats on Tuesday
Jordan for you no calculator everybody else you can have your calculator
Are we allowed to use the new books
Toolkits we dont use on the tests
Any other questions
Anybody planning on doing the retake of year one you need to make sure you let me know so that I prepare and have copies of the retake in separate classes
Any questions on the retake from our first test
Any questions about what math class that you need to sign up for
You can take this and AP stats if you want but its not recommended
Yes
Yes
Right
How that works is you take the Front Range class and I think its Miss Butler that youd have to talk to
Shell tell you the specific class
You would still sign up for this and then after the summer you take the trig precalc final pass that and then you could skip that and start cal fit
The other requirement is that you have all As in all the maths classes in high school
Is that the only class to do over the summer or is there like others
The only reason that I know about that class is just because some people do want to skip in from math three and then be able to take calculus
Over the summer you mean
No just like
Its a yearlong
Itll be a single class a single period
From here on out you wont have any blocks
Yes
Yes
Other questions
Okay
All ready
If you would please pull out that blue piece of paper that we worked on yesterday
All right
Lets put the problem number five first
This is one of the problems where A is one
The phrase we need to remember is factors of C that add up to B
We look at our C value over here
Our systematic way of looking at factors is to just start with one and then two and three and four and five and we stop when we notice we already have a number even if its the opposite sign in my list
This is a systematic way not to miss any of those and then with that set we also switch the signs
The positive becomes negative and the negative becomes positive so well always have two sets to choose from
Then we want to find the one that adds up to B and so we look at these add them up and see which one it is
Then we absolutely have it easy because those numbers get stuck over here into our intercept form
What kind of intercepts are we talking about
Xintercepts
Xintercepts
That makes it easy then when we want to find our Xintercepts because whats always true about an Xintercept
Y is zero
Y is zero
If my Y is zero if this is supposed to equal zero one of those two factors has to be zero
The work we show is modeled here its called the zero product property
Product means we are multiplying so we have our answer as zero a zero product property
We set it equal to zero and solve
This is the kind of work you need to be used to doing
Then the Yintercept whats always true about a Yintercept
X is zero
X is zero so it doesnt matter
You could plug zero into here and immediately know what it is or you could put zero in here and we just be multiplying two times 5 and we come up with the same answer
Now since level three or any constructed response problem is a communication between the two of us you have to show me work
Now this looks like Do I really need to show work for this
Yes show at least one step
It doesnt matter to me which one of the two standard or vertex forms you use but you should do something or lets just even say Y instead of F of X for this since were finding the Y value
Just plug in zero for X and thats good enough to show the work for that
That would just means you know how to go about doing the math for that
All right
Any questions on the intercepts
All right it sounds like the good time for person number three
If youre person number three raise your hand
That is you Jordan
All right
Person number three explain what weve done so far in factoring in finding the intercepts
Not right now but today when we are done
Those two factors are
All right
Person number four survey your team are there any questions in your team that nobodys asked yet
Person number four
All right eyes upright please
All right any residual questions on either of those factoring or finding intercepts
Yes sir
How did we make originally it was 10 so what do we do to make that 10
Up here
On the paper is it negative or positive
Negative
Oh it is negative okay
When we were doing the example yesterday that we took notes on
Right that was a different problem
Yes
It was just but it was different
It just so it happened that both of the C values had a 10
Both the axis have a three
Yes is that right
Yes
All right so any other questions
All right so lets keep looking at this example
If I know my two Xintercepts I know those two thats what Ive figured out so far and I know this guy down here my Yintercept
What do I know about my line of symmetry
Its in the center of those
If its in the center of those how do I find the center
Average the root
We are going to average the root
Remember root is just another name for Xintercepts and on the calculator the calculator uses the term zeros
Zeros Xintercept root all mean the same thing were just to average them
Now what if we werent able to factor it what do we do then
We use the opposite of B over 2A
Thats the same thing
Thats the first part of that quadratic formula is right here
This is the opposite of B over 2A
Its our line of symmetry and we have to add something and subtract something from it to find our Xintercepts
All right if we know the X value if we know our line of symmetry what do we do then to find the vertex
Plug the X value
Yes we just plug that X value into the equation to find out what the vertex is and do that calculation
At that point we have one two three four points
Those are the key points we would be looking for and because we know that line of symmetry we know this one and can graph that and then we just connect the dots
All right
Person number one survey your team find out if they have any questions about any of that starting from the top going down
All right any questions
All right problem number six
The difference is our A value
We dont have a 1 anymore
Now back in the day I never heard about factoring by grouping when I was in high school
I would do guess and check
If I look at this first term my choices were either to multiply 6X times X or 2X times 3X
Nice with these numbers I only had two options which to try to figure out
Then Id look at this last term here and know that these two have to be multiplied to end up with this and Id just start guessing which combination of numbers that I would need
Fortunately if youre pretty intuitive this might actually work for you but youve got to show me some kind of work that shows that you understand the things that you have to multiply together to get our first term the things we multiply together to get the last term and then its all about figuring out which combination would add to 1X here
The system though that we have is to do factoring by grouping
This phrase has only changed a little bit
The factors of A times C so instead of saying the factors of C its the factors of A times C
In fact if you just memorize this when A is 1 its still the same thing
Actually this is probably the phrase to learn if youre going to learn just one
The factors of A times C that add up to B
A times C 12 list out all my factors do my second set find out what B is which one adds up and then the difference is that these two numbers are about how I split my linear term
In other words those two numbers are not my factors those two numbers is how I split this because 3 and 4 they add up to 1
If I have 3X and 4X of this I havent changed my equation or anything
Thats what my standard format looks like
Ive split my linear term into those two
Then I look at these first two and say Well what could I factor out
I can factor out the 3X and whats left behind is here
This guy times this it has to equal that this guy times this is equal that then over here what can I factor out of this
Once Ive done that notice that whats in parentheses is the same thing thats what were looking for
Because then I can pull out of this and put it in front
Once I pull this out and put it in front what am I left with
3X2
Its just that
Theres my two factors
Then I use that zero product property I said this guy equal to zero
I said that guy equal to zero and solve
Those are my two Xintercepts
All right any questions on that part
All right
Then looking at the green my line of symmetry Ive got my two Xintercepts so I add them up and divide by 2 that gets a little trickier with the fractions so Ive got to convert these to a common denominator
346 gives me the 16 and Im dividing by 2 and I wrote it this way because you might remember that when you divide you can change it to multiplication if you flip the second term so you copy change and flip
I dont know if you might have heard that before
Thats how it makes it a little bit easier when were working with dividing fractions
If I know X how do I find Y I plug it in and I end up having my vertex and then Im ready to graph those points
The key difference with this is this phrase right here and the factors of A times C then add it to B
All right so questions on either of those
In fact Ill put both of them up there
If you want a photo of it feel free to grab your phone particularly so that you can capture that factoring part
These should be mapped to toolkits that youve got
All right you can go ahead and put that blue sheet of paper away and grab a journal and a textbook
All right
Page 54 in the journal
All right person number two with a team
All right person number two with the team
Person number two you get to be the reader
Read the essential questions but continue with the discussion of whats that blue word and the red word mean
Person number two go
All right let me have your attention
Thank you for those of you that are being aggressive and going after this exploration as well but lets first make sure we understand what quadratic means
Whats quadratic mean
Square
Say it again
Four points
Four points
Kind of interesting right
Because quad means what
Four
Where does the four come from when we think about a quadratic
Because its X to what power
I guess if we squared it and make a square its got four sides
Square is four sides
All right so quadratic were talking about the function family thats Y equals X squared
What does it mean to model something
Do you have a synonym for model
Replicate
Replicate display show
Whats the math thing
If were modeling it what are we trying to find
Whats the answer look like
Symbols a graph
Were looking at an axis of symmetry
Its an E word
Its an equation
Its an equation
Before following something were trying to find the equation that matches the data we collected
Thats the whole point about of this
Luke you were so profound when you read that exploration
Could you do us a favor and read through A
A
Yes start at the top but read through A
Is the value of a positive negative or zero explain
Now Im looking for like with a partner the graph shows
With a partner the graph shows a  function of the form that equation which approximates the view of its  company
How much is the profit in a year
T T going through A
Is the value of a positive negative or zero
Explain
Weve been given a question about explain period
Whats the P stands for
Profit
Profit
Whats T stands for
Time
Time and
Period
What are we inputting and what are we outputting
What do we input for this
T
T so were inputting the number of
Years
Years and then we find out
The profit
How much profit the company is making
Notice my input is always what goes on my Xaxis my output is whats on my Y
The A value positive negative or zero
Positive
You dont sound very convinced
Positive
Positive
Its positive which means my parabola opens up or down
Up
Up and that makes me very happy because I really like positive things in my life
All right so if it opens up do I have a min or a max
A minimum
A minimum value
In this story person number three what does that minimum value mean
Interpret the minimum value for this story
Person number three go
Person number three go
How many are here
The minimum value shows me the lowest profit in that year
Its a specific year
Its a specific dollar value and its a specific year
Now if I want to find out what year that is so which way is my year
Is my year over there on the Y or is it on the X
X
If we want to find the year I want to find the X
If Im given standard form how do I find the X value of the minimum
You guys are too good
Much better than my other class
That first half of the quadratic formula tells me the X value of that minimum and then if I want to find out what the dollar value is I
Plug in
Plug it in
Continuing on Part C Jordan Lets have you read
Part C
The company made the same yearly profits in 2012
Estimate the  with this profit
All right so if P is the same for both of those years when did they make the least profit
Somebody said 2008
Another 2008
Were thinking 2008 so if P profit is the same that represents a horizontal line
Just to kind of make it fit with our graph would at these two times make profit be the same
Yes
Yes
Yes
When did I make the least
In the between
In between those two
Im averaging them again
That year then is
Add them up divide by two
Chase D please
All listen up
Are the yearly profit going to be increasing decreasing or constant
Explain
What year are we in today
So are the profits increasing decreasing or staying constant
Increasing
Increasing
Does this keep increasing
Yes
Yes
Yes
We can answer the question that today their profits should be increasing if thats a good model
Anything particularly tricky about going from the naked math of no story to today weve got a story
We just use all that same vocabulary but we try to put it in context with profits and in this case time in years
Any questions about doing that
Then were going to skip number two and Id like you to go to page 56 in the journal
Page 56
Youre looking for the core concept
Youre going to cross out the third option
Were not going to do that
Oh it is
On 56
No its not
Yes it is
Right here
Yes it is 56
Its on the bottom of the page
Oh I see it
There you go
Cross off that last one
I want to show you the first one
In your prompt youre given a point and a vertex and even if they dont tell you what type of form to choose if they give us the vertex lets know that we have to pick the vertex form to start with so if I know my vertex is 2 where do those go in here
H and K
They go in for H and K I simply take my 2 put it in for H notice I still copy that minus sign down and if this had been a 2 if that first number was 2 I would have put minus 2 or positive
Then I added that 2 there
That gets me started but they told me another point
What do I do with that 046
It turns out thats probably the case over here
We could figure that out by knowing that line of symmetry and looking that up
We could find it but does this vertex form half Yintercept as a plugin value
No
No
No
What do I do with X and Y
Add it to X and Y
I plug it in the place of X and Y because how can I get A it says everything here is numbers except for the letter A
So I do all my work find out what it is
Then dont miss this step
Dont stop there
Make sure you rewrite the equation with that A value in there
Does it always have to be this where two equal  Yes
Well you get partial credit
You entered the problem correctly
You get full if you wrote the whole thing
You want to make sure that youve got that
All right
If Im given 18K Im going to plug in K Im going to plug in H and Im going to plug in the X and plug in the Y
Then I find A and I rewrite my equation
All right person number three explain to your team whats given and whats the strategy to finding the model
Person number three go
Person number three go
Question
Are you doing okay
Yes
Yes I hear you
Especially on a Friday
We always feel we would make it work if we knew we had Monday afternoon
All right
Harper do you guys have a question for me over there
Shoot
All right go and ahead and ask the question
No I got it now
You got it
Okay
Any other questions
No maam
All right option two
Lets say weve been given a point only now we know the Xintercepts
If we know the Xintercepts we should use the
Intercept form
All right theres a little tie there right
Thats where were going to start
Here we have it
Theres our Xintercepts
Theres another point
It happens to be the vertex in this case but because we have intercepts were going to use this
Jesse
On the test do we get like a paper thing that sets the equation or you know
No
No
We have to memorize them
Yes
Yes
How many are there
How many are there
Well in this case theres really only two
Well like in the whole thing
Like the whole unit
I dont know Id have to look at the likes toolkits you know
Five or six
The toolkits would tell us
All right
Eyes up front please
Its one or two but where is it a bit comfortable
The next intercept theyre all synonyms roots zeros Xintercepts all mean the same thing
P and Q are technically just the Xintercepts
Yes
Yes
Thats why they say Xintercepts P and Q
When you write the equation on the test if you wrote that one
Thats right
You enter the problem correctly
Weve got roots Xintercept zeros
Im just going to take those numbers the 4 and the six and drop them in there
Notice I did keep the negative sign
Then what do you think were going to do with X and y
Plug them in the equation
Plug them in for X and Y
Now we have all numbers with the exception of the A
We have to start solving
One plus four is five one minus six 5
Ive got a 25A divide both sides by 25
A equals 1 and dont forget to write it back in
Now what if this problem asked you to put your answer in standard form
What would you have to do
You unfactor it
Yes you unfactor it multiply it out you got to distribute that
Could I have started with the vertex form to solve
I got a point and the vertex I got a point and a vertex right
If I was given this I could have done this or this but in both cases I would have to multiply out and remember this is X minus H times XH Do not think that means its X2 plus H2
Remember its these two times itself again youll have four terms combine the like terms so dont make that mistake
All right
So these are your two strategies for solving the problems on Page 57 you are only doing one through eight so you dont need to turn the page theres more problems on the back were not going to do the ones on the next page
In your teams youre going to assume the same role you had yesterday conductor coach et cetera
Make sure everybodys on the same page or same problem same time
No hogs no logs go ahead conductors get it started
Yes dont be long
I wont be long
Conductor whats everybody working on
I want to make sure everybody gets on the same place
Do not include the 0 at the end just when you first start
Theres a certain comfort
You might have it if you do solve and  you could show that
Coaches the answers are up here if you need to check them
Can you plug in the Xintercept if the
No youd have to use a different point
If youve already used it here you got to have something else
Correct
What is this
Its a microphone for capturing students  like for examole if I understand this resource better
If you asked me questions and I said here let me show you how to do it
That wouldnt be very good to teach or talk
Everybody came up with the same things
Did you do the work
Walk me through what youve got here
Weve plugged in the vertex here to the  then we plugged in the second
Theres the problem
Do you want to expand it
When you multiplied it out and you got te 4 that 4A and then 3 after it
4As
Then divide
But why
Why cant you not do that
Because its connected to the A
Its part of the A right
Its part of the A and
Keep at it this way
If its 4X plus 3 why cant you say thats 7X
Because
Exactly
Math term we would say theyre not like terms
Youre taking Xs and think about the three as popsicle sticks
You cant combine As and popsicle sticks because its not the same thing
Then what we do is we use reverse PEMDAS to decide which we do first
The reverse of that the last two is adding subtracting
When Im solving for X I go backwards so I do the adding or subtracting at first then multiplication or division part
Okay thank you
Really important question
How are you doing
You getting ready answers
You havent checked yet
Youre just ignoring her and youre on your phone
Do you feel like knobs
Youre good
So you guys are done
Take a little mental break if you do need to go to bathroom or get a drink just inquire
How is things over here
We are going to need
Thats all you have to do
You check your answers
You can go take a break out there
Just dont cause a scene
How are you guys
I dont know the actual answer
What were we asking what is what
He really does need to work
What was not correct
Theyre all correct cool
you just going to catch up
Youve got one more to catch up on
Let me know when youre done
Oh my goodness
You got two more done
They do look very similar
Whats the difference
This one has
Okay and
Im sure it somehow or another
Is there a camera in this one
No theres no camera but Im imagining that this could control the angle try and try and put up those swivels
Hi there
How are you feeling
Pretty good
Are you doing okay
Yes
Do you have  today
No
I noticed I havent seen a lot of homework getting done
I do much homework
What was your grade on the test
Which test
test
Got a 94
You did pretty good
Yes
Are you an A student
I dont think so no
say I am
Go for As
So if youre an A student you are bale to do A work in on a test
Yes I usually do homework  and I dont understand it or something then I do some homework to help me understand it  something that I understand
Okay as long as you know its different on the  grade for you
I might  like 5 or something and then I wont be
Correct because even if you got half the points
It still be 5
It would be yes
Anything that you can do to add points to that is in your favor
Let me know if you need any help
Yes thank you
Its good for you to learn that today
All right ladies and gentlemen lets try to pick up the speed on this if at all possible we want to shoot for being done in about five minutes
Its not a one
kind of a Y
No that is my way
Everyone else says its a 4
I think it is
Where is the 4
Thats a 4
This is a 10
That looks like a 4 not a Y
Thats a 4
Yes I would tend to think that was a 4 not a Y
All right ladies and gentlemen for the sake of your own minds lets go ahead and call it quits for the journal and the book
You can go ahead and put those away
Go out in the hallway
Have a good of a break
Wait guys youre not disappearing on me
Come back up here
Were just hanging out for a little break
All right ladies and gentlemen lets clear your desks except for a pencil and your toolkit
Its quiz time
No
Now I would like everybody to set a good example for Reed on what it looks like for your phone to be off and off of you
Phones in the bag pack
No headphones no phones on you theyre off and off of you
Isolation from my bag
Yes well I would prefer that it be a team quiz
Yes
Oh no calculators
No calculators
This is not though whats affectionately called a box quiz
That means we toss the papers into the box and I skipped one out and thats the one I grade for your team
For the whole like
For the four of you
All right let me have your team quizes
A team quiz means team voices
Team voices mean I cant  what anybody in the room is saying when Im sitting up here and you cant tell what that team next to you and saying
Team voices and phones off and off of you and you can use your toolkit but not notebook so that notebook needs to get put away and no calculators today
The journal needs to be put away please
Calculator needs to be put away
Team voices
You should have some points that are exact that you are talking about
