All right seems like everybody got the toolkit so well press on
Joanne whats step one
Isolate the radical on one side of the equation
Isolate the radical on one side of the equation
For this particular example whats our first step going to be David
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Whats it going to take for us to get the radical by itself to divide by
Yes divide by two
Very good David
Thats going to be our first step so dividing both sides by 2 we end up with 4 2 gives us 2
Whats step two Tobias
Get rid of the plus one
Get rid of the plus one
Jill
I can get rid of the radical
Get rid of the radical
How do we know when we can get rid of the radical Tobias
When theres nothing outside of it and theres no other part of the equation thats like it
Yes basically nothing outside of the radical on that side of the equation so were good
How are we going to go about doing that
Tobias
Dont you multiply it by itself
Dont you square it
I could multiply it by itself
Lets say if I did  x  and then Id have x1 over here
Simplifying this Id end up with x1 but then I have this
Its not going to go over
Yes so have I simplified
No
Yes thats certainly a strategy were going to use at times so we want to remember that as an option
In this case what do you think we should do Cordelia
Then we have to solve the resulting equation
Were not quite there yet
Jason
Square it
You raise each side of the equation to the same exponent so then youd square both sides
That is what we want to do
When we square both sides what happens to the radicals and the exponent
They disappear we end up with 22 so that gives us x14
Now we just need to simplify one step equation kind of thing
Eliza what are we going to do to get x by itself now
You minus one
Minus one yes so we end up with x equals
Three
Three
Three yes so weve got that as our answer then
Whats the next step Nadia
Youre done
Were good
No
No
No
No
No
Joel
You have to substitute the xy back into the
Right so were going to check our answer
Were going to stick the three back into the equation basically asking the question does it hold true
When I solve the left side is it going to equal four
In this case yes indeed it does
We want to do all three of those theyre all four of those steps as you Oh no lets do it again weve got another one
Heres our equation were going to start with
Jimmy what are we going to do first
Were going to add one to both sides of the equation
Now what was step one Joel
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
When we add one to both sides will we have isolated the radical or are we done with that
Yes
Yes
Right so we add 1 to both sides so 21 gives us a 3 now weve got the radical by itself
Carson what are we going to do next
Whats step two
We cube each side
Yes cube each side
Yes were going to cube each side
Whatever we have here and whats 33 going to give us
Twentyseven
Twentyseven and what happens here
The radical and the exponent it basically goes away and were left with a two step equation
Zach whats the two steps that weve got to go through for this
To get x by itself here whats my two steps
Cube each side
Weve done that were left with this two step equation
Add nine to each side then divide by two
Perfect now why did you say add nine as the first step instead of dividing by two first
Because otherwise you would still have the nine remaining
What would 9 2 give me
Four point five
Yes we probably dont want to deal with that
Can you guys think what is the math reason that we use that says why we add nine first
Order of operations
Say that again
Order of operations
Order of operations
What is order of operations
Refresh our memory
Its reverse order of operations
It is its backwards
We were solving for x this is the rationale and thats why we do that add and subtract first
Yes you
I have a question about
If you add 9 to either side youd be left with 36 then if you divide by 2 you get left with 18 but if you divide it by 2 and 27 then you get
Thirteen and a half
If I divide by two what do I have to do
I have to divide everything by two so well still come up with the right answer
Were just dealing then with decimals where we dont really have to
Yes yes you just simplify
Its not
Its not so good
Yes its not too bad but in more complex problems we wouldnt want to be doing that so we end up with the two x36 2 as Zach said and we now have 18
Then wed plug 18 back into the original equation and make sure that its going to equal 2
We can take a look at that and so it checks out in this case
Now what were going to do is these are your first practice problems
Youve got three practice problems to work with you and your partner
If you and your partner cant agree then go ahead and talk to more folks in your team
First three problems on that extra piece of paper you got
Weve probably done the two on that
Is that  equations
No
No
No
Youll see some others that I have
At any point if you and your partner want to check the answers they are on the monitor at my desk if you want to check for answers
Thats why I gave you that to get started on
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolated the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical
When you look at the original what is it that I want to isolate
you want to isolate
Yes so what do you have to do first
You have to get rid of this
Yes because otherwise the radical is not by itself
Who needs more time on these three problems
Ladies and gentlemen
Eyes up on the front please
Lets see
Brittany we havent heard much from you so could you read the big paragraph
Using each side of an equation to the same exponent range of the solutions that are not solutions of the  equation
C solutions are called x solutions
When you use  you should always check each apparent solution in the original equation
This is why the checking becomes really important
Lets see who else have we not heard from
Weve heard from Jane but you havent read
Could you read that attend to precision
Understand how extraneous solutions can be introduced
Consider the equation  x3
This equation has no real solution
However you obtain x9 after squaring each side
In this particular example Brittany whats step one
Isolate the thing
Isolate the
Weve isolated the radical so step two then
Get rid of the radical
Get rid of the radical so in this case we would raise it to
A second power
A second power and we would end up with x29
Yes
Wait what
No x9
Im sorry yes x9
If I plug nine back in here whats  9
Three
Three
Thats where were
Thats showing us that you dont always get the right answer in these problems and so were going to go through some of those
Technicallycould you just not check it and understand that if its equal to a negative then its not going to have a solution
Well but if it was a cube root then a negative answer could have been appropriate but then there could still be one right answer and one wrong answer
One way or another youve got to think about checking it whether you know to check it that wayas you were describing or you just do the math
Were going to do this particular problem
Brittany whats step number one
Isolate the radical
Isolate the radical so what do Ive to do to isolate the radical in this case
Brittany
Yes
What do I have to do to isolate the radical here
Its already isolated
There you go
Yes good
Its already isolated
Step two was
Get rid of the radical
Get rid of the radical
What am I going to do to both sides
Square
Square both sides
Now were getting spicy
Why are we getting spicy
Foil
We do have to foil that
We have to distribute the
I still dont know the foil is
Thats okay because foil is
Just one method of it
Yes
Its a double distribution
Whats going to happen here Brittany
Those cancel out
They cancel out
What happened between here and here
I dont know
You foiled it
Yes we foiled it first outer inner last
You got to remember that this means  x
Ive got the x2
Ive got one x there and another x there for two over there
table method
Table method I think is a great way of organizing to multiply those
I agree
Whats step three of the process
Solve for x
Solve for x
How do we solve for x in this case
Joel what are we going to do
Im gonna subtract the 1
You got a different idea
What are you thinking
You could subtract 7x and subtract 15 and just factor your brand new trinomial from there
I could do that and what would I end up with over here
Zero
Equals zero
Establishing zero
Yes and then we can use the zero product property if we can factor whats left over here
What would be left over here is an x2 combining these
A negative I guess
Combining those
Minus 14
Are there factors of negative 14 that add up to 7
Yes
We can factor them
Were going to use that strategy simply because we have quadratic linear and constants all in this
Now if I didnt have these linear one
Id put that one over there and then take the square root of both sides
In this particular case since I have that linear term and the quadratic term I have to go through that process of factoring use the zero product property
My x values are
Negative two and seven
Negative two and seven
Youve got those
Whats the last step Brittany
You solve for x
We did solve for x
Oh I knew that
We got that
What comes right after that
We plug it back in and check and make sure
Yes were going to check our answer
We have two answers to plug back in so you want to be careful about how you do go through that process
Lo and behold one of them doesnt come out true
This is that example of an extraneous solution
an example of a headache
Yes its a headache
We did all of our math correct but because we started doing things like squaring both sides it morphed into something that is not going to really solve the original equation
Yes
If I remember it correctly but Im not sure  of the solutions could be correct
Not that Ive seen so far but I think the answer would be yes
In your toolkit go ahead and have that toolkit open in front of you we have this little note right here now about extraneous solutions
Step four lets write a note
You dont necessarily have to write everything you see here but you do need to write something that explains this whole idea of extraneous solutions
I will  the song
The next example were going to go through is where we actually have two radicals
How are we going to work with more than one radical
We have this equation that were starting with
What do you guys think that were going to do
Talk with your partner
What do you think our first step is for solving this kind of problem
Even though we have two radicals and we have something thats outside of a radical were squaring both sides
Notice that we arent selective about what were squaring
Its everything on the left and everything on the right gets squared
What does it look like once we finish that
Thankfully this side looks a whole lot less complex
Its really easy to do it
Then I have to do that whole distribution
When I multiply this lets look at it
Weve got  x
When we look at that and I multiply these two things together Im just left with the x2
Theres that
When I multiply those two together and I multiply those two together I get two of those guys
Thats where we see that we have 2 of the x2 under the
Then my last one to do is multiply 1x1
We have that plus one there
You havent seen problems like this before
We just have to think through that process
Now what do you think were going to need to do
Just simplify
Were going to do that simplifying thing
Where do we have some like terms
Theres a plus two and a three over here
Also the x
There is an x and an x over here
You would just subtract in both sides
We got this guy here too with the numbers
What do you think our strategy is here
Where are we going to put everything Tobias
I would first of all just subtract all the constants so I would subtract two and one in both sides
What happens then if I subtract two and one
What happens over here
Youre getting rid of the entire three because that equals three so you can
Yes so thatll go away
We are simplifying its getting more simple as we go
Then you subtract x from both sides which will get you negative two x
Ive got a negative two x
Then
Then you divide both sides by two
Divide by two that gets rid of that
That gets you back to negative x and then you just square both sides and then it just gives you x2x2
In other words what Tobias was saying is were going to isolate the radical
Were basically going back to step one isolate the radical whats it going to take to do that
We want to get this guy by itself
Thats all were going to do
A lot of steps to that
You got to keep track
You got to be careful when you draw your radical symbols that youre not making it look like the plus one is included or the plus two is not included
You got to be really careful when you write them
As we walk through that process we eventually get to the point that we have isolated the radical
Brittany after we isolate the radical what do we do
Yes
Okay
We square both sides and were left with x2x2
Oh my goodness
Were back at this simplifying step
Weve got a quadratic we got a linear term weve got a constant
What are we going to do
Factor
Yes were going to see if we can factor so that means everythings going to go on one side
Do I want to subtract all of this or subtract that
Subtract the x in the negative two
Why would I prefer to move these over here instead of moving that over here
To keep the leading coefficient positive
Yes so we can have a positive one with the x2
That is the next step
Are there factors of negative two that add up to negative one
Yes
They would be
Negative two or positive one
We can factor
We can come up with our answers using the zero product property
Then its time to check
Lo and behold one of them works one of them doesnt work
Weve got this extraneous solution thing going on here
We cant use the x value of two
We just have one answer
Were going to practice
Before I do that
In these cases if we have calculators which were not going to have the calculators on the test
Also these arent that hard
They are only basic equations
Its not complex stuff
Its right
That last one when we solved it even though there were a lot of steps to it there wasnt anything we couldnt do
going to make us graph that by hand
No I dont think so
My guess is more it would be like a level two multiple choice
Match the equation with the graph or match the graph with the equation kind of thing
Describe the translations from the parent function kind of thing
Are we going to have graphs on the level threes
You mean have to graph things
I dont know at this point
Actually I havent seen the test
Im not making the test this time
Is the extraneous answer always going to be when x is negative
I dont know well look for patterns and see
In looking for patterns it looks like whenever x is negative
Yes with our sample set
Pretty small
In these types of equations if you graph one side of the equal sign and then graph the other so theyve put them in y one and y two we can use the second calc intersect option on the calculator to come up with our answer
Notice how it only came up with x1
What did we come up with over here
Whats the one answer that works
x2
Where we plugged in the negative one
Thats the one that worked
could have just waited for the question to be answered
Yes
Thats okay
I have a question
Yes
Whos making the test
Mrhow do you say his name
There we go
Heres some practice problems that have two radicals in them
Brittany whats going to be our first step
Isolate the radical
We cant if theres two of them
Square
Yes were going to square both sides
when one is a cube root and one is a square root
Well yes youd probably raised it to the sixth power
You dont want to do that when
Can we write these on the paper
Yes
This is what youre writing on your paper
These are problems five six and seven
Ill have the answers on my screen when youre ready to check
Which one do you want to move
How do I factor that
Joel explain to her how to factor that
You got all of those
Yes
Have you checked your answers yet
Let it be said that four x is equal to x squared which means that x has to equal four because if something is squared then it means that the number times itself
Im good at math
Whats our first step
Think about it this way if I have negative two x minus two x what would I have
Negative four
Yes so I have negative four times the square root
Then Im dividing by negative four which is quite right
We got to everything
Is that what you got
Now its like Im starting all over again
Ive got all this and now were back to step one
I isolated that I square those signs
Whos done with the three problems
We got a good group of people done
Lets just take another minute or so
Here is number seven for you to refer to
All right
Who needs help
Anybody need help
Joel did you all do the problem
Christian Branson can die
Im not actually going to kill him so please dont turn me in
Im just having a moment right now
Okay guys okay
All right ladies and gentlemen
Were going to move on to a new example
Vijay lets come back to your seat
I was helping Joel
Joel you too
Brittany be very careful about how you word the first step for this problem
What are we going to do
Whats the goal
Whats step one for this type of problem because we just switched problems
What I would do is to make that into a radical and then write
Or we could treat is as the fourth root to x cubed
Subtract two
Isolate it
Im looking for something along those lines
Joel
Isolate the exponent
Isolate the exponent
Were not dealing with radicals right now
Were dealing with rational exponents
Whatever has this rational exponent remember rational just means its a fraction
Weve got to isolate that
Matt whats our first step
The first step is to minus two
Yes so well subtract two from both sides
On the left side we get an
Eight
eight
Now what do we do Cordelia
You have to like do the flippy thingy
The flippy thingy
Where are you making it into the radical
What are we going to flip
The three fourth thing
The three fourth
What do we call that when we flip it
I dont know but you flip it
Reciprocal
Reciprocal
Yes reciprocal
We have four thirds and we got to do that as well
Because three fourth times fourthirds equals
One
Now we have to take eight and raise it to the fourthirds power
Lets imagine this is a test question and you dont have a calculator
How do you want to think about eight to the fourthirds power
Would it be  fourth root of eight
You find the cube root of eight and thats two and then you multiply that by the other exponent
Heres where weve got to make sure we understand which one of those numbers goes where
If you remember that if we said the square root of four is the same thing as four to the one half that helps us remember that the index is the denominator
I dont know if we could think index has a D in it and its a denominator
Figure out some way of remembering that
Obviously it was easier to find the cube root of eight first than it would have been to do the other way around
We could have said we wanted to find eight to the fourth and then take the cube root of that but I really dont want to multiply eight times eight times eight times eight
There is a route thats going to simplify that
Okay
Last step here Jared
Divide both sides by two
Divide by two
X is going to equal
Eight
Yes we check our answer
Plug eight in
Turns out it works
We have our solution
That is ridiculously simple
I have a question
Yes
Its basically when youre doing the raise each sides of four thirds youre putting the power of the reciprocal of both sides
Right because whatever we do to one side we got to do to the other and we do it to everything
Another example
Whats our first step Brittany
Well it already is isolated
It is isolated
What is isolated
The rational exponent so like that
Nice good good
What are we going to raise both sides to
Two over one
Two over one
Two over one just is
Squared
Were just going to square both sides
Do you have to use brackets or can you use more parentheses
Typically you see if theres parentheses that use brackets but more parentheses is fine
would use the bigger parentheses
Yes thats fine
We end up with x plus 30 equals x squared
Joel what are you going to do if I got a quadratic a constant and a linear term
Subtract the x over
Subtract the x over okay
Then you get 30 equals x
Then what do I do
Wouldnt it just be 30 equals x
No because thats x squared
What do you think
Go ahead
You have to subtract the 30 Im assuming
Weve got the 30
If we subtract that then this whole thing is going to equal
Zero
Are there factors of negative 30 that add up to negative 1
Oh yes
Five and six
Five and six
Which one has to be negative
Negative six
Six will have to be the negative one
We come down to where we can factor
Joel when we have quadratic constant and linear terms what do we want to do
Factor it
Were going to go towards factoring but in between what do we want to do
Set it equal to zero
Set it equal to zero
Yes
When we see we have those three different types of terms we want to set it equal to zero we factor so my two possible solutions here are going to be
Positive six and negative five
There we go
Weve got those
Lo and behold once we check one of them doesnt work
Lets remember how important that checking process is so that we have the right answer
All right
Lets practice eight nine and 10 on your paper
Yes
Can we take a break
Thats on the safe side
Whats negative 12 times 3 going to be
Negative 36
Is there some number times itself three times Remember when we wrote those out here the other day
Whats two to the third equal
Two times two times two
Two times two times two equals
Eight
Is eight a factor of 36
Whats three times three times three
Thats actually 27
Will negative 3 times negative 3 times negative 3 be negative 27
Yes
Thank you Caroline
Now I plug in Whats three times negative nine
The cube root of negative 27 is
Bingo okay
Youll plug this in then add it and then take the square root of it
Nine the square root of nine is three and then
Who is not done
Who is not done and needs a little more time
Ladies and gentlemen our last example
Last example here
Were now looking at inequality so what we do if we have radicals or rational exponents and were solving an inequality
In other words we have an inequality symbol thats the only thing we see thats different
We could have any kind of algebraic expression underneath the radical so the radicand could be x squared plus four x minus six
Remember we could have any root we want
Its going to be pretty similar once weve isolated the radical well raise it to the power
Theres one thing that we have to consider is values of the radicand that makes sense
For example can we take the square root of a negative number
No
No
No
No
In other words weve got to make sure that if were taking a square root that were considering the fact that the radicand has to be positive
For example if we ended up having something like x minus two that were working with this x minus two would have to be greater than zero
Now if I add two to both sides x has to be greater than zero
Is it okay to have zero in the radical
Can it equal zero
Is that okay
Yes
Yes because when you take the square root to zero right
Im going to add a little equal bar
In this particular case not only do we have to solve the problem but I also have to think about Oh if this has to be a positive value then thats going to put a limitation on my input values my x values my independent variables
Now were going to solve this guy weve got a less than or equal to symbol
Brittany what do we have to do
Divide by three
Weve got to divide by three so we do that first
Equals four
Weve got that now and then what are we going to do to both sides
Get rid of the radical
Get rid of the radical so such as a square root were going to square both sides
Four squared is
Weve got the x minus 1 is less than or equal to 16
We then
Add one
Add one and so were left with this expression that x can be any values that are less than or equal to 17
I think  does the inequality symbol ever switch because  divided by negative number you have to switch it
Right so what would have caused it to switch
How could I change my original
Multiply with negative
Yes because when I divide by a negative I would have had to change that
When I multiply or divide by a negative number thats when its switched so yes that could happen
Now I not only have this but now I got to look x minus one because its a square root has to be a positive number so greater than or equal to zero
X has to be greater than or equal to
Now I got to combine these two and check does it make sense
Can I have x values that are less than or equal to 17 and greater than or equal to 1 and how would I write my final answer to show that both of those are true
X is in between what two numbers
1 and 17
Im always going to use a less than symbol and then I have to ask do I need to add the equal sign to it
Im going to express my final answer with those considerations
Lets show you the rest of that and then this is checking it on the calculator
Thats our last example solving like we normally solve plus considering if this guy has  on it if its an even root well have to evaluate that
Heres our last two practice problems
Sure is it already queued up or
No
No okay
Do exponents switch to inequality
Tobias you better be nice to me
I will
Dont worry
Im not going to bully you
Its just amazing
Thats it for the examples and then that does mean that Heres the practice problems to go with  plan
I would recommend that you check the website
