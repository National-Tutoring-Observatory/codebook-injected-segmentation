Yes thats on
Its for a study
It records the lesson and gives information about how much I talk versus how much they talk
All right I see some disagreements here
Taylor why dont you
I was waiting
You just change the number at  the name
If I look at her work I notice something
I see where she went wrong
Who can help her notice where she went wrong
Coach her
Jen
She kept the six
Okay true
But look at her work because I think her work is where I see something that maybe got her confused
Shannon
She put the eight so everything after the decimal  number that you need changed
Okay
All right but thats still not where the first mistake happened
Lets think back to whats the first step that were supposed to do and what do you notice about Jackies work in that first step
Talk to her not me
Coach her
Jessica
Jackie you underlined the seven and the six is in the tenth place
Under fix your mistake what is something she did correct with that
Because I see some work that was correct
Avery
She knew that
Talk to her
You knew that the six was there then bought so you rounded up to seven
I disagree
What about that arrow
Did she do the arrow to the neighbor correctly
Yes
Okay
Jackie whats your next step
You underline you look at an arrow then what
You round to seven
Nice and clear
Okay
Fix your answer based on what you just said
All right I agree
What I love about Jackie is that growth mindset and how you guys helped her figure out the mistake and how that shows that very simple step of underlining thank you Jackie the digit that you are rounding to really can make a difference in whether you have the right answer or not
Remembering that the only digit that changes is the well not the only digit the digit that youre going to keep the same or go up one is the underlined digit
I change it to red hoping that would help us see better
Taden second one
I see a big mix
I see some sideways
Why are you sideways Jessica
He didnt show his work
Why dont you use the original problem to show your work
Instead of rewriting it you could just use the original
Instead of rewriting it you can just use the numbers that are already up there right
Could you underline from there
Then this could turn into
I cant hear you
This will  the touchpoints will turn into the Y because I dont know
Okay
What would make his answer even better
I agree
I would never mark what he wrote down on the test but what would make it even better
Todd
It would be better if he used math vocabulary
He used a little math vocabulary
I agree you could use more
Im looking specifically at what he wrote though
What could he make better about what he wrote
What have I told you about the zeros after the decimal
Marianne
Put all the zeros that used to be there
No I actually have not told you that
I said you can but thats not best
What did I say is best for zeros after the decimal that end it
Harper
That you can just replace one and you dont have to put the zeros
Yes
Yes
If there are zeros after the decimal spot thank you Taylor we dont typically write them
Im not going to mark you wrong if you do but I really want you to get in the habit of leaving them off because that is how you see the numbers
If I were to ask you to write 50 right now I dont think most of you would write decimal 000
The actual value of that seven is 45 in seventenths not 45 and 700 thousands
Yes its technically the same if you were to color it in a picture but the best practice is zeros after need to be left off
I want you to think about what I said
With your purple partner partner wearing closest to school spirit so if youre not wearing school spirit our colors are blue and green so whoevers got the most blue and green on pants count is first
Show me a thumbs up when youve figured out whos first
That partner is going to say What do we do with zeros that end the decimal
Go
Five four three two and one
Taylor what do we do with zeros that come at the end of the decimal
You leave them off
You raise them
Yes
Yes
What I want to be clear is what Im talking about is something like this versus something like this
If it ends the decimal you dont need them
If its in the middle you need it
You never erase it in the middle
Okay
Its kind of like would I write a zero here in front of my three
No
No its the same with the decimal after the decimal
We dont write it before the whole number and we dont write it after the last number of the decimal but do not take them out of the middle
If theres a zero in the middle you leave
Partner who didnt talk before what do you do if theres a zero in the middle of the decimal
Go
All right friends if you could meet me on the rug in 10 seconds
Please bring your pencil and your math journal
Two of my friends I see in the back
Rob I see going to the front
Thank you
Okay
Excuse me
All right
Please read our first target today Emma
I can read
I disagree
Formation
Not quite
You are at the end of the word Emma
Youre kind of putting something thats not here
So lets chunk it
Whats this
Oh my goodness
Go back
Go back
No not that far
Here Ive got an idea
First say this part
The next three
Game
Sorry
Blend that together
A game
Close
Coordinate
Coordinate
Very close
Conjecture and maybe thats what you said
I couldnt hear because there was some whispering in the back
All right
I can use what I know about coordinate graphs to create a conjuncture
Now a conjuncture is a fancy math word for an educated prediction
Our markers are kept our stuff is down
Were engaged in the lesson and the learning
A conjuncture is a fancy math word for a prediction based on math
Taking what you know about math and then making a prediction about what you think is going to happen
ET high five someone to close you
If youre being blinded you could always either close that or just ask me to close it
I dont see all of my partners here
ET high five so I can see whos partners with who
It looks like Blackstar Mala Marcello Jon Avery Taden
Rob who are you with
Youre going to need to join a group of three but youve got to show me who that group is with
All right
With your partner
I want you to repeat in your own words what is a conjecture
Sorry
Go
Okay
You two are together you two are together and you two are together
Robs here in the middle
You can join any of these three groups but you cant just sit here and do nothing
What group are you going to join
You can make the choice Rob or I will make the choice for you
You
I can
Okay
Why dont you join this group right here with these boys
All right
Next
Todd whats our next target
I can plot ordered pairs correctly on a grid
Okay
Show me thumbs up thumbs down sideways
Where are you feeling on this one
Because this is not our first time weve encountered that target
A lot of people feel successful some people are here
Today were going to even more practice and hopefully move my friends here all the way up
Take a moment to read my little cartoon about conjecture to give you a clearer idea of what that is
With your partner how is that a conjecture
How is what the man is saying a conjecture
Go
Jen are you and the Rita partners
Okay
You want to look at her when shes talking
Well think about whats a conjecture
Write down there the definition if you forgot and how does that fit
Hannah what do you think
How is that picture a conjecture
The picture is a conjecture because it says that hes trying that he thinks in a continent is trying to balance the books so he thinks like hes guessing
Then is he just guessing randomly
No
How does he know
Because
Lets start with a complete sentence
He knows because
He knows because the books are
Whats he doing
Whats the other man doing
Whats the man with the books doing
Balancing the books
This is an obvious thing but how it relates to the idea of conjecture is that the man is not saying that the new accountant is trying to balance the books which by the way is a joke about accounting because as you will be learning with young AmeriTowne balancing the books and thats actually something weve done once so far this year is making sure that your records match the bank records
Thats called balancingm like balancing your checkbook
Thats like the joke of it but its conjecture because hes using his evidence
Hes not just making a crazy guess
Hes using what he sees and what he knows to make a prediction
Now in the cartoon its supposed to be funny
Its obvious
All right
Jen can you please read our first success criteria
The successful one I can plot once from the older pairs
Okay
Ethan
I understand what happens from the point on the Xaxis gets the Y too small
Joel
I know  I understand
Avery
I know its successful when I can use mathematical evidence in vocabulary to explain my thinking
All right
The last three are going to be our big focus today
Our purpose is going to be what happens to a picture as we change the coordinates on the X and Yaxis
As you talk with each other I really want you to focus on that conjecture using math evidence using what you know and using that correct vocabulary
Where can we find correct vocabulary if we need itI love how Shannon is pointing
For now its their
Gael pay attention my friend
Can you tilt our easel please so the class can see the poster better
Tilt it this way so it faces the group better
Sure
All right
Getting our brains back to math and a little bit of practice
Heres what this is about
I do not want you to tell me the answer
I want you to tell me which of these would the answer be closest to
To figure that out youre thinking about the value of the fraction
For example threefifths
Is that closer to zero half or one
Show me zero half one
Okay I see a bit of a mix
Todd youre showing me one
Why do you say that
I think its closer to one because
What is
35 I think 35 is closer to one because
Okay
Im going to ask that you talk with your partner whichever one you said half or one I want you to think right now
So dont talk yet
Just think
Why
Why did you give me that answer
Todd Im coming back to you
Now share with your partner
Back to you Todd
I think the closer I mean I think 35 is closer to one because the three is closer to the five
Okay
What would half of five be
Two and a half
Okay
I hear two and a half
I hear 25
How would we say that
Okay
25 how do we say that correctly
Think
Two and a half
Okay
Im not sure that youre understanding my question so let me clarify
25 that is a decimal right
So how would 25 its not accurately using math vocabulary how we say decimals
How would we say 25 as a decimal
If it helps you use your tools write it down look at it thats okay but how would we say 25
Think
Were all going to say it together
Two and fivetenths
Now my friends who arent looking at me didnt know to talk right Rachel
Because you werent looking at me so you didnt see the signal
2 510
So is three closer to 2 510 or five
What do you think
What do you think
Two and fivetenths
Yes 2 510 which means thats actually closer to a half
I would consider threefifths closer to a half
Now think about 14
Would 14 be closer to zero
Half
Or one
Place them together
No were not placing them together yet
Okay
Im seeing a lot of zeros
So this question is asking and what Im going to ask you to do on your own in just a moment is I want you to think
35 is close to a half 14 is close to zero 12 plus zero equals 12 so that means the answer must be closest to this is one
Because it is
Why do you say it is
Never mind
No not never mind
Boys and girls when you have a thought come to your head or you feel you have an answer stuff went on in your brain to get you that answer and all Im asking is that you share whats going on in your brain because none of us are like Okay whats Sasha thinking right nowYes I agree with you Sasha
Because were not mind readers
So when I call on you to share your thinking I just want you to share whats going on in your brain
Thats not hard because its going on in your brain
You know its there
Sasha
14 is bigger than 15 so
I see what shes thinking
Shes thinking if you did 15 plus 35 thatd be 45 which is closer to one and 14 is even bigger than that so itd be even bigger than and even be more close to one
All right
I can see that
The tricky thing about 14 is its smack in the middle of zero and half
I think thinking about well 35 is closest to half but its a little bit over
If Im going to put 14 to it which is even closer which is like smack in the middle thats going to bring it even closer to one
Does that make sense too
So thinking about it I think Sasha had a really great way of visualizing it and then also when you have 14 its tricky because its right in the middle
Lets just do one more and then we need to move on
What is this one closer to
Write it on your whiteboard
Show me
Okay first of all lets look at our options up there I see some people showing things that arent an option
So look at the options on the top
Make sure that youre showing one of those options
Show me
Jackie I cant tell what your option is
What are they when we put them together
Whats it closer to
All right
I see mostly twos but I also see a 1 and 12 and 12
So my friends who put two think
Why would 12 be incorrect
And my friend who put halfs my friend who put half why might that be incorrect
Who would like to share their thinking
Avery
I dont think 12 is the correct answer because 3 and 38
Annie sorry
Because 38 is close to a half is closest to 12 so thats like already almost 12 and then plus 1 25 wold be way more than half
Is 1 23 over a half
Yes
Youre adding more to that
So half doesnt make sense because one of my digits is already way over a half
One of my digits is already closest to what number
Two
So that would be for my friends who put 1 12 I would say the same thing
1 23 is already bigger than 1 12 and Im adding even more to that
So thats going to push me up close to two
All right nice job
You have this in your math journal on page 134 and 135
Please take a moment to turn
We arent really going to be using our whiteboards anymore
You can put them in the marker up to the side
Im not saying I wont ask you to write an ordered pair or something on it
So still have it accessible but okay
So please point
Never mind
You cant point to anything
Its going to be right here
All right
Right now point in your book on page 135 to where it says original sailboat
Point to that
Look at your neighbor
Make sure theyre pointing to the right thing
Help them if theyre not
Friends I didnt say tap this is pointing
This is not  not what Im asking for
All right the original sailboat
You are going to plot these points right here
Fiveone
Plot that on here
Take a moment to plot those points
Thats okay
Im going to ask you to stop because I need to clarify something
When youre plotting these points you need to do what I call dot connect because youre going to be creating a picture
If Im looking at fiveone Im going to put it here
Then whats my next one
Fiveseven
X five Y seven
Im going to dot connect and make a line
Then the next point
Ive done both of these
Actually Ill do a check
Come on friend
There we go
Check and check
Next youre going to plot one two and dot connect
Every single one you make every dot you connect it to your last dot
Im going to write some names up here to come and plot for us and as soon as theyve plotted the next name come up
Ill move
Then you can see them
In the meantime youre working on your own
Yes
Yes
What do you mean
Im sorry
Youre right
Its cut off at the top
Let me see this real fast
Come on up black star
Thank you
You pointed out sorry sorry sorry
It was cut off up here so I didnt see it
You guys on yours
If you look at the chart under original sailboat youll see all these same coordinates
Your name is next to it
As soon as youre done you hand it to Maggie whos going to do it
Dont forget dot connect
You guys are all plotting right now
Show me a thumbs up if youre done and you have your picture
If youre not done keep working
Can I see your book
Friends this also has your coordinates right here
If you cant see whats up here you can look at your book right here and get the coordinates
If theres a dot here already you dot connect for the last plot we made
Hold on
The last point that was made was this one
Connect the dots
Youre always dot connect to the last point that was made
Okay
Pass it on
Jon and Avery your eyes arent here
Im going to ask Jon what do you think about the last point
Hold on Shannon
What do you think about it
The last point
You also have your book in front of you where you can look and if you were paying attention to what was going on
I think I agree
I saw quite a few people agreeing which makes me wonder what your sailboats look like
Whats the important thing to tell coach Rachel about
Because shes close but she made that very common mistake
Ethan what do you think
Which one comes first
X axis
Which one is the X
Right but which line is the X
You went up to but youve got to remember think of an airplane
An airplane has to taxi before it goes up
Go over to and then zero
This is the X
You have to go over one two
I know its hidden but theres a zero right here
This is the zero line for Y
This is the zero line for X
Wed go one two and wed leave it there because the Y is zero
Nope down here
You switched that one
No it says two zero
Thats X over two up zero
I did not switch them
No you said the tall line
No listen
Listen to what I said because I said it correctly
This line here is zero
If theres a zero in the Y I said this is the line is zero for the Yaxis
Anytime the line is zero its always going to be on that bottom line
Anytime the X is zero its always going to be on this line
Thats what I was saying and that is not
Now connect to the last coordinate
Okay
All right
Double check yours
Did you make that same flip mistake
Because I saw a lot of thumbs up with Rachels point
I know its tricky because the numbers are hidden here
I wonder if I can get rid of that
Hold on lets see if I cant get rid of that
Careful how youre holding the pen
No thats not what I want at all
Wait
A little bit further up
Here
No not good enough
Stop it
Hold on
Not good enough
Im going to use the mouse
Can I get rid of this
Go away okay Shannon what I was saying is that even though there are no numbers here because this toolkit is blocking it we still know one two you can still count the lines to figure it up
There you go connect to the last one
Okay we want to be careful when we are connecting that you use a straight line what tool when you get back to your seat could you use to help you
Rita
Pardon in a nice complete sentence
When you get back your seat you will
Right you want to make sure that you are using tools to help you if needed all right
Just press that little the two arrows pointing towards each other yes press that it will all go away
All right so your sailboat looks like this sailboat
Yes
If it doesnt that means you made a little mistake and you want to doublecheck all of your coordinates
All right now I want you to take a look at the chart that says New sailboat number two
Number one sorry new sailboat number one
Found it
Put your finger on it check with your neighbor are they looking at the right place
Please read to me whats the rule of that new sailboat is Kevin
That well double each number of the original thing
Okay so what does double mean
Think for a moment think think think share with your partner
Rita what does double mean
Double means to multiply the number by two
I love that wonderful complete sentence so eight times two equals
X times two is 16 we go to the Y one times two is
Two
Theres our new coordinate pair first before you graph anything I see people with their pencils up either finishing or have I asked you to write anything yet
No
What was one of our learning targets today that had to do with this word right here
Shannon
Give the same words
Yes in your own words it doesnt have to be exact but what are we doing with this word today
We are
Okay so I want you to show me a thumbs up if youre trying to think right now of what that learning target with conjecture was thumbs down if youre just waiting and thinking about other things waiting for Shannon to do the work for you of thinking
Yes no ones going to probably put their thumb down and admit that but I can tell that many people good
Im glad youre honest I can tell that many people are just waiting for Shannon to do the work for them thats not what you do if I ask her a question and shes thinking you are also thinking because what if I say Jessica
Which happens to be the one with the hand raised Help her out
Were making an educated guess based on math
Say it in your own words
We are making an education guess in our own
Were making an educated guess based on math
Based on everything
Just whatever we feel based on what
Think about what Jessica said Jessica will you repeat it for me please
Were going to make an educated guess based on math
Based on the math
Okay so if Im going to make an educated guess based on math for my conjecture so what do I think is going to happen to the new boat
What is my new boat going to look like
Thats what the conjecture is asking what is your new boat going to look like
Share that with your partner just the question what question are we going to solve
Stop because I hear people answering it I didnt ask you to share your answer because you havent had time to think to make a good conjecture
Share what is the question youre making a conjecture about
Go
Five four three two and one so in order to do that we have to have an understanding of what
Who can share what do we need to have an understanding of in order to make a good conjecture and Im giving you a big hint right now as I do that
Ben
How to make X
Right so we have to have a good understanding of what happens to the X when you go bigger or smaller what happens to the Y when you go bigger or smaller
Okay so take a moment right now to think what conjecture could you make about your sailboat when we double the numbers
Mr Michaels will you let Jared in and then put the magnet in the door
Okay share with your partner
Arianna what do you think
My conjecture that its going to get bigger
Whats it
The sailboat is going to get bigger
Okay Rylee whats your conjecture
I agree with Arianna I also think that the new sailboat is going to get bigger two times I suppose as the original sailboat
Okay Harmony
My conjecture is you will see it is bigger and will be if you double the numbers
Okay so Harmony listening to your friends who came before then do you agree disagree
I agree
Okay I want you to make sure with your conjecture youre very specific because bigger whats getting bigger
Is it getting taller is it getting wider
Is it getting both
I love the two times bigger but I still need a little bit more specificity okay so think about that
When when you say bigger and by the way I did not see my
active listening thumbs
I if I say that I dont mean every single person theres usually always two or three or four people
I mean as a class I need to see everybody not just a spattering
So repeat to your partner with more specific whats your conjecture
Go
Waterfall
Sean whats your new conjecture thats a little more specific
My new conjecture is like the boat will like times two when its and like um size
Okay so think about my hint what can Sean add to make his even better
What can Sean add to make his even better Hannah
Sean can add how this how the new sailboats going to get bigger like taller and wider or both
What do you think
What do you think
Taller wider or both
Both
Okay
Why
Because like all these all the totals are going to get taller and wider
See on the 017 and 801
Okay
One thing I love that Sean did is I saw him struggling a little bit with the math vocabulary
He looked behind him at the poster to affirm what vocabulary he needed to use
All right
Take a moment please to finish this up
Im going to use my cards to come up here and write them in
Youre finishing them but youre also listening to your name so you can come up here Sophie
Youre just going to go in order
Youre timesing both by two
Annie youre after Sophie
Raelynn after Annie then Jon then Jackie and last Elise
You guys are doing it on your paper while you wait
Then youre handing it to the next person whos thank you very much Annie for remembering and standing up
Who was after Raelynn
Jon
I love that
I saw some active listening thumbs
Okay
Okay
All right
I love those active listening thumbs
Everybody got that correctly
Next step is to graph it
Graph it
Wait Im looking around
No one wrote their conjecture down
I know I didnt write it on mine just because I knew I was going to move
Please pause for a moment and write your conjecture down using that specific math vocabulary that was a part of our target today
Once your conjecture is written then you can start plotting
I wrote the numbers up because it was faster than writing names of the people who are going to plot
In this order youre going to come up and plot the new sailboat points
Please take a look at that
Taylors going to start with the 8 1 and then Blackstar is going to finish not with 8 1
Its the second conjecture
It was at 16 2 and then black stars going to finish with 16 2 so if your number is in the middle take a look and see which plot points youre going to plot and we can get started
Go ahead and do the first
You can finish up your own estimate
Keep plotting yours Jackie
Plot your own
Dont worry about what theyre doing
Just keep plotting until youre finished with your own
Can you make your dot a little bit bigger
Thank you
Todd is next
Hannah
This was the first second third fourth
Countdown before we start to see which one that is
Make your dot bigger for me
There you go
Jen is next
Jen youre doing the fifth one down
Hannah I think you Hold on Jen
I think you plotted the original not the new sailboat
Lets get that back to Hannah and then stay right here unless you need to doublecheck your thinking
Because youre plotting the new one not the old ones
Once youve finished plotting your sailboat youre going to take a look and start using your active listening thumbs
Its the fifth one down
Okay
Right now youre not working ahead
Youre looking here and helping them out
Who can help Jen out
What coordinates is she supposed to be plotting
Call on someone Jen you can choose someone to help you
2 4
No
Hannah just did the 2 4
Thanks
10 2
Plot the points 10 2
Friends if your numbers up here make sure you know which coordinate youre plotting based on looking at your own book
Ethans next please push this thing to make it go away
Again youll have to be really careful about pushing that button
Next person be standing ready to take this so we can speed this up a little bit
Next person hello
Joel just went
Whose turn is it next
I have a question
Hang on
Could I not get into class
You should be able to
All right friends
What do you think
What do you think
This look like your sailboat
Yes
Yes
Now show me yes or no was your conjecture correct
Yes
Think why
Why was your conjecture correct
Okay thank you
Why was your conjecture correct
Share with your partner
Why was you conjecture correct
What were you trying to go
I was trying to get in
That you have to go to not there so go here to the table score entry  some sort and then okay you have to go here and choose that day and then thatll open it up because you have to first say what day youre doing it
Now you can click on the conjecture
All right
Five four three two and one
Hold on
My friends waiting for the restroom
Who have I not really heard from today
I have not really heard from Jackie
Was your conjecture right
Why or why not
My conjecture was right because I said that it was  and but I wasnt
I have no idea what she just said sorry
Pass that to her
My conjecture was right because I said that like if I want to get wider and taller and whatever like times  by two the numbers  so like it will look like taller and wider
My question then is why does timesing this x by two make it wider
Nicole
On the
You can pass that to her
On the xaxis everything like if it was eight and then you have it multiplied by two and itll be 16
Then bottom of the sailboat or  is on and you have to give  it out and stretch further
All right the next step boys and girls is you are going to complete sailboats two and three
Your conjecture because thats one of our learning targets as well as the order pairs as well as the graph
When you are finished you are going to tear out the page that has the graphs and turn that in as your exit slip
What about the back page
Yes
Yes
Do we do that too
Let me see what the back
Thats what we should be doing
Actually yes
Thats probably going to take us about 15 to 20 minutes
Probably up till 1030 so youre going to do that and yes you may have snack once you get to your desk and you are working independently
I will put our targets back up to remind you what you need to focus on
Lets just follow the order
