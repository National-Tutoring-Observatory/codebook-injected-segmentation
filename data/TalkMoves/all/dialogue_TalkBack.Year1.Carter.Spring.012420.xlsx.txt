Read it with me please
Study that diagram there and you thumbs up when you understand that diagram and how its demonstrating multiplying fractions by whole numbers
Fabulous
Going to have you talk with your shoulder partner please
Partner A goes first
Ready
Go
Okay
Lets just make sure  we understand that diagram and how it demonstrates multiplying fractions by whole numbers
can you explain that
I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre doing 26  26
I dont hear a lot of people or see a lot of people ringing in
Did you not hear her
Okay
Can you try again just so that everybody knows what you said so they can feedback you
I think that two of the blocks are a whole and theyre adding 26  26  26  26 because thats the same thing as 4 x 26
Okay theres people kind of going
Can you call on somebody to respond to you please
Stella
No I agree with her
Oh
Hudson
I see why you thought that each two squares equals a whole because I think you got confused by where the 4 when it said 4 x 26 theres four groups of two inside that you thought that two blocks equal the whole
I still disagree
I dont know what you mean by blocks
Both of you keep using this word blocks
We have two different shapes up there
What are the shapes that are colored called
Say it in your hands
Let it out
Squares
What are the squares part of
Say that in your hands
Now say it out loud
Rectangles
Now can you modify your explanation using that vocabulary to help us
Thank you
Two squares and the rectangle are equal to a whole
Why do you say that theyre equal to a whole
Im confused about that part
Because theyre supposed to be four wholes so two of them
Respond to her ask her a question if possible
Okay somebody thats saying Hey can I ask you a question to help you
What does each square represent
16
So would 16 really represent the whole
What represents the whole in this diagram
The rectangle
The rectangle represents the whole
What do you guys think of that Conor
Yes
Yes
Yes
How is this showing that its 4 x 26 again
Explain your thinking again
Because there are four 26 which is
Im still confused what youre talking about whole of 26
What do you mean by that
I think she means
Hold on she can do this
Shes so close
Because the whole rectangle is colored in and so that must be a whole
Then the 26 are the two squares in the next rectangle
Okay and so you have how many 26
Four
Four so youre showing 4 x 26
And you explained that one way of showing it is your addition and another way of showing it through multiplication
Whats your learning here
I
Everybody think
What would you say  learning could be
Because it applies to a lot of us not just
Im sure of it
Whats the learning here for everybody about how we explain our thinking
Its partner Bs turn to go first
Tell your partner Whats the learning
Ready
Go
whats your learning
To use better vocabulary
How many of you said to use really specific vocabulary
Good
Did you have anything else you wanted to add
Well okay
Anybody else have anything that you thought you should add
Charlie
Make your answer clear and
Do you think using the vocabulary helps to make that more clear
Oaklee
Make sure it makes sense
Make sure your answer makes sense
And that vocabulary could be a component of that
Great
Thank you
Nicely done
You did a good job handling that
I know its hard when Im questioning you
Im trying to help you work on being really clear and being very specific
Youre going to be solving a problem
Thats how you know that your  on solving this is getting the correct answer
All right
Yesterday  vocabulary
Were going to do a practice problem on our Slate before we finish that journal paper with our partner
Great job with coming up with the success criteria  by the way
Those are fabulous
Im just going to move those
Yesterday we were practicing two strategies
One that we had learned the day before that involved finding a unit fraction and multiplying that times the numerator
The other one was multiplying the numerator times the whole number and dividing the deno the whole then dividing that component by the denominator
Those were the two ways
Im remembering that but Im still a little confused
Okay so heres the problem
If you got time do both strategies
If you dont have time pick a strategy that you know best to solve with
12 x 34 or 34 of 12
Pick a strategy you know best to solve that
Please do it on your Slate
You can look in your math journal
I dont want just an answer I want to see how you got to your answer
topic  person two is going to start by showing their work and discussing it with the team
Ready
Go
Okay thank you
There were several people that did a great job with explaining
But in the effort to conserve time for the other lesson I want to cover today Im going  here
This was the first method that we talked about earlier this week
Does it matter if I say 34 x 12 first
No
No their the same
all right
I took 12 and I put it into four groups because thats how many groups were dividing it in here
This is a 14 this is a 14 this is a 14 this is a 14 but were finding what three of those groups are because thats the numerator
Theres three here three here three here that equals nine
Thank you
Would this be practical with larger whole numbers
No
No
No
Thats why you are trying to move away from making pictures but sometimes pictures help that get really clear to us so we understand
I would just divide this by four multiply it times three because I find the unit fraction by dividing it by four I find one unit and multiply it times three
Rate how well you understand this method
Okay super
Then yesterday we talked about another method
This method was more of the equation form taking the whole number multiplying it times the numerator and then dividing it by four
Here I would have 36 divided by four which equals nine
That was the second way
Rate how well you understand that way
Okay fabulous
I do want to say that there were several students that left math yesterday to go to another math group
So it would be clear that they would need a little instruction a little practice a little explanation
So please be kind and patient and understand what that would be like if somebody said Wait class for the entire time and Now today were talking about it And can we expect them to know what we talked about
No
No so please be kind and patient just as you always are
All right
Let me have you work with your partner back on page 170
You need to read and follow directions and complete 170 with your partner
If somebody was gone maybe youre doing SageNScribe so that they see what we did
All right ready
Go
Were on the twominute warning
Okay friends
Because were on day two of this lesson we are going to just quickly check it because Id really like to get to the other lesson today as well all right
I feel like we checked number one A and B yesterday
Number two what did you get for an answer
Charlie
I got 12
What do you guys think 12
I got 12 and 48
Excellent
48 is it the same thing as 12
Yes
I am totally fine if you leave it as 48
Im totally fine if you put it as 12
Both of those make sense
Nicely done
Number four
You need to tell us the number model and the answer please
Troy number four
I didnt
All right
Thank you
Because remember some of us were not in the room yesterday
Stella number four please
Number four our number  10 x 45
Equals R Just put the variable
So if you didnt have a variable please add that
10 x 45  R Are you dividing
No multiplying
She used 48 Does it say 48 or 45
She used 45 of it to tie a bow how much of the ribbon did she use
Its multiplying
Youre not breaking it into groups
Youre multiplying
Then what was the actual answer
The right answer I got eight feet
Eight feet
Nicely done but remember  incorrect so you both need to fix that
Thats why Im saying that
Hudson
Is this number okay
10 x 48   by 5
It is but were also looking for it is a fraction
Thats what the whole point of this lesson is
Look at the top of your page
See
It says multiplying whole numbers by fractions
So should it be expressed as a fraction
Yes
Yes
Is it the same as saying x 4   5
Yes but keep learning intention in mind okay
Thank you
Good question
Number five Alijah
My number model was 14 x 56  F
You agree
What dont you agree with Oaklee
Well he could say it differently
I agree with him but he also could say 14 x 5  70   6  F
No
No
Remember what we just talked about with Hudson
Hudson tell him what we just said
We just said we want to The learning intention is about  use it as a fraction
Yes multiplying whole numbers by fractions so its present as the fraction even though thats what the process was for you to solve it
Okay Oaklee does that make sense
Then what was the actual answer Alijah
11 and 46
You have to include the unit
11 and 46 feet
11 and 46 feet or another way of saying that would be 11 and 23 feet okay
Thank you
We are going to close this lesson before we go on so lets go back to this
First of all I know Im successful when I can apply one of the strategies practiced in this lesson on problems two and four on page 170
So rate how well you were able to
Its okay to be a two if you werent here
Its okay right
If youre like Im getting parts of this but Im not quite where I need to be
Its okay especially if you werent in the room
I dont know how I would function at all so thank you
Thank you
Lets look at this
Read the summary with me
play the game so were not going to be able to summarize
There we go
Start
Now we are on the next lesson
Lets read the learning intention
So how is this lesson different than what we were just doing
Sorry Im choking on my own spit
Thank you
You can laugh
It is funny
Do
Yes
So talk with your page partner
Whats different about what were going to start now than what we were just doing
Ready
Go
How is this different Gabriella
This is different because were multiplying whole numbers by fractions to find fractions
Thats what weve been doing but what are we going to be doing now
Go to the last line of the learning intention
Finding fractions of fractions
Yes so now youre multiplying fractions by fractions
How many of you said that
Yes thats what were doing
I want to make sure you understand what apply means
Can you please read the word applys definition for us Charlie
Apply to complete  using what you have learned already
Does that makes sense
Yes
Then extend
Show me a definition of extend
Were adding on
We knew this much now were adding on all right
So we are going to take what we learned previously and add on
This is how youre going to know that youve
Can someone read this for us
I dont know
I have  I can explain how one or take  model is a representation of fraction products
And  what that means
Talk with your partner about what that means please
Thank you
Clay what does this mean that we have to be able to do
It means that were going to have to be able to explain how our paper folding model or drawing helps us explain how we did the fraction product
Whats fraction product
What our answer was
From multiplying
A fraction times a fraction
You got it
Thats what those papers in the center of your team are
I had one group of people that were like Oh my gosh what does this mean to my weekend plan
It means nothing to your weekend plan
Its what the tools are for us
You see how  paper folding models so well be using those
Lets look at No there is no more vocabulary
Perfect
apply Slate and Slate I think is a good transition for us
So
Thank you
All right here we go
Find 12 of 12
Way to go
You said 6 x You have 12 of twelve donuts
Thats a lot of donuts
Youd want to share right
No
Asher
Youre my new favorite
12 of 15
Great job
If you said 7 and 12 youre correct
Who can explain how they got 7 and 12 because some of us are still back at 12 of 15
What do I do
Harlowe
I thought 7 and 12 was I thought the closest number to 15 that could be divided in two groups which was 14 and I know 14   2 is 7
So we need an actual one to get  fifteen
If we break 1 into 2 itd be half   I one of those half to my answers
split your dozen donuts between two people
Thats generous definitely
No its not
You have fifteen donuts
Here we go
One Does that say 12 of 40
Yes
Okay
12 of 40
Flash
Way to go
Nice job
Now were going to do a little more challenging
Nothing crazy
23 of 12
We just answered that
Yes we did just answer that
Good job
FlashGood job
Ive got some friends that said four
Most of us said eight
Think for a minute
My friends that said four what step do they need to still do
What does it sound like they did
What did they do River
Were all still finishing the  I have  by two to get eight
So youve found what
I did find 13 and then I  by two
To find 23
Great job River with your explanation
Take your time my little friends that were like Four back to a Eight
Heres the next one
23 of 15
FlashNice job if you said 10
Marcos what do you need to do
Once you come What do you need to do
You have to multiply it by this numerator here 23 not just 13
Okay
Good
Youre putting this together now
Do you see why we do this
It helps you figure some things out
Is this what weve been practicing
Yes
Same thing
23 of 60
Flash
One of you go
You want to do another round of it
Yes
Fun right
Okay
25 of 12   remainder as a fraction
Thats what you were just doing also
FlashOh my
Were breaking down
Houston were breaking down
I see some people that have
Yes
Yes
If you have no idea what to do talk with your team
if you have some idea write it on your own
All right
Who can explain what it is 4 and 45 for us
What
Yes
Yes
I saw it
I know three people that have it
Hank
I did 12   5 is 10 and 25
And then we do Its 2 and 25 then when you do that times two you get 4 and 45
Im not sure I understand
Can you write it out to show us
You can use the whiteboard you can do it on your slate and put it under the  cameraI need to see a visual of your thinking please
Im so visual
Is anybody else in here so visual
Yes
Okay
Go through it with   I see that you wrote it this way
You started by saying 12 and then you switched it to 25 of 12
Does it matter
Whats 2 x 3
six
Whats 3 x 2
Six
Six
Does it matter if you say 25 of 12 and 12 of 25
Does the order matter
No
It doesnt but keep going
Go ahead
Your marker is kind of faint you might want to grab my marker
I think it might be  but yours has been a little worn out with all of yourhard work
There you go
Hes like Yes Im right
Ms Rupus I think theres a black one
Okay Hank your point is to explain it while youre doing it
Can you do that
25 of 12
What I thought was 12   5 equals because 5 x 2 is 10 and then you have 25 left
Its 5  2 and 25
Then I did that times 2 and then I got 4 and 45
What did you find when you divided twelve by five
What were you finding what part of the fraction
Everybody talk with their partner
When he divided it initially by five divided the whole number by five what was he finding
What was he finding when he divided by five initially
Hank
I was finding 15 of 12
And then why did you multiply it times two
I multiplied it times two because were going to be finding 25 of 12
I did find the numerator which was two
What would be a way to check a reasonable list of this
How do you check
No were not making an estimate
Think about your answer your product
Think about your product
How would you know if your product is probably correct
Its not when an estimate  If you multiply 12 x 12 that would be putting an estimate way but theres another way
Ryland
You can see 4 and 45 isnt that close to 12
If you got something really close to 12 like 10 and 45 then you would know that your it isnt probably not going to be right
Youre only finding 25 of 12
Your product should be less than both of those factors shouldnt it
Nicely done
Thank you
I can tell we need another practice of this
This is what we were  in the Math lesson
Were going to need another one of this
Lets give Micale a round of applause
Nice job keeping your composure when youre on the hot seat there
25 of 31
25 of 31
Awesome
Thank you
Im going to  just to generate a bunch of things how long you think a couple of hours
Perfect
All right flash please
Ive noticed that all of our answers are definitely smaller than both the factors that sounds good
Im going to show you this
Yes
If you did not get this talk to your team
If you cant see what your error was
All right
Back to me
Back to me
I get this I need to practice some more
Did you get what Im doing I need to practice some more  Lets move on to the math message then
Mental math inclusive
Math message
Work with a partner to solve the following problems
You may use drawings open circle pieces or the fraction number line poster to help you
One 12 of 3
Two 12 of 34
Remember the learning attention
Weve been doing this type of problem like number on
Were moving towards doing the problem like number two
Make sure youre not dominating make sure you let your partner do some of the thinking too
Both brains are working
Ready go
Ready go
Can explain our thinking
I saw some people with drawings for number one
Franc has a drawing that they do on the  under there  to show us
Thank you  and Wren way to go Penelope
Show us  yay yes
Thank you
Yes so if you want to  You might want to shrink this
Were on number one
12 of 3
Save this thank you
Save it
Somebody that did 12 of 3 as a drawing
Thank you as a drawing
Okay great
Thats what were looking for
I want that
too
I think  time
What I did was I drew the two rules because I drew one plus one equals two
Then I drew two halves because  a half plus a half that will be  two
12 plus 12 will equal three
Nicely done
Thank you very much way to go
Theres two people Im going to invite up there now
Its actually three people  to go
Im going to have you guys go and then Im going to have you show  circles
Go on up both all of you who are ready to go because were losing daylight
Closing in on the end
Okay talk to us about your thinking
My thinking was theres  and then since theres 24 going into each  I put a one and two and then since you  theres only one more
You have the  equal share
I split it into half and I gave one and two
Each half gets one
You split half of the fourth
How did you know that a four could be broken into eighths
I see your answer there
Eighths are equivalent to fours you can make
Eighths are equivalent to fourths
One eighth is equivalent to one fourth
No
No
Fourths are equivalent to eighth
Fours are equivalent to eighths
A fourth 14 is equal to 18
How many eighths are equivalent to 14
Two
Two 28 is equivalent to 14
How can you prove that
Its because
Draw something that proves it
Explain your thinking
I drew eights and this are equal to four
What do you guys think
Do you agree
Yes
Good
All right
What do you think
Can they make a good drawing
Can they explain their thinking well
Yes nice job
Give them a round of applause
Very well done
Okay lets see the  circle pieces because that might help some of us too
Nicely done
Since  12 and 34
We
Since we were trying to get 12 of 34 we knew that 12 of 34 wasnt youre going to do 12 of 34 because theres not enough
34 thats just three  If you do just three you cant split three into 12 and you cant say 1 and 12 of the first fraction where we said 12 of three because were doing a fraction not a whole number
We got eights and we knew that 28 is equivalent to 14
We dont need  We knew that 28 is equivalent to 14 and Since 28 is equivalent to 14 we said Since theres 34 we said theyre 68
You could split six into half into a half and half of six is three
We said the answer is 38 because half of six is three and if we do 68 its dividable by 12 because
I think you could still use the fourths because you could show Okay this fourth goes to this person and this fourth goes to this half
Maybe show us that show us that we will not
You could do
Move them kind of a side
There you go
This is one person this is the other person
They each get 14
Theres 14 remaining so you split 14 into 12 and you give each person 18
Put your eighths on there
Yes
to show that
Since there is 14 remaining and theres two people you can put 28 over the fourth
Then you can give each person 18 then it would be 14 it would be 38 because 28 is equivalent to 14 like weve said
It pretty much gives you them a 38 if you give him 18
What do you think
Great job
Great job knowing the equivalents and I can tell you understand the equivalents I can tell they understand the equivalents
Round of applause
Nicely done
Very good
All right
Lets go Now were finding fractions of fractions
What you just did that second problem is what were doing today
Now were going to work into  Here we go
Lets get you hungry
Just in time for snacks
Aww
Read the scenario which is
Larry has half of a fruit bar
He wants to give half of what he has to his brother
What part of a whole fruit bar will Larry give to his brother
I know that some of you already have ideas
Thats fabulous
Were going to do the paperfolding part of this
All right
Everybody get a sheet of the paper and Id like you to get two markers out as well
Two differentcolored markers
Here we go
Eyes on me please
I want you to take your paper and fold it in half vertically
This is a model
Remember how are making models for science fair
We made science models God bless you
This is a model of the fruit bar
God bless you
Does he have an entire fruit bar
No
No
No
This is how much of a fruit bar he has
Youre going to take one marker and make slashes like I just did
What does this represent
Shoulder partner A tell shoulder partner B What does this represent
Back to me please
Eliana what does this represent
This represents a fruit bar
I just took it out of its wrapper
This represents what
Half
This represents what from our problem Eliana
This is how much Larry has
Look at the problem
Larry has half of a fruit bar
He doesnt have the whole thing he only has half
Thats what these lines represent
Okay
I get this part so far I dont get it
Now Im going to take my fruit bar that I have half of and Im going to give half of it to my brother
Im going to fold it in half
Folding it in half
Because I have half and Im going to give half to my brother because hes a nice guy
Take your other marker and I want you to shade dont shade yet Im going to show you how I want you to do it
I want you to shade the opposite direction
See how Im making Xs when I shade the opposite direction
Thats why I wanted you to slash diagonally and this is diagonal again with the other  What does this represent
What does this represent now
Partner B explain to partner A what this represents
Back to me
Back to me
What does this now represent Davis
It represents Larrys brothers side
Do you think  Yes
How much does his brother have
If you want to open up the paper
This was the whole granola bar fruit bar
How many parts have we broken it into
Show me
Show me
Four
Four
How many parts did Larry have
Two
Two
How many parts does his brother have
One
One
Out of how many parts
Four
He had one out of the whole fruit bar but Larry had only half
I wanted you to see how we came up with the name 14
All right
I get this model I dont get this model
Pretty fun isnt it
He had 14 of that fruit bar
All right
Do you want to try another one
No
Yes
Good
I love your enthusiasm
Oh I wish Juliet were here
Her names up here
Who would like to read our question for us
Thank you
Jimmy
Juliet has 12  She eats 23 of the part of the pizza she has
How much of a whole pizza did she eat
What does this paper like this now represent
Now let it out
A whole pizza
Does she have a whole pizza
No
No
No so fold your paper in half vertically like we did before
What are we going to do on this part of the paper and why
Tell your shoulder partner its Partner As turn
Ready go
Ready go
back to me
Thank you
What does this represent
What does this represent
Britny
This side of the pizza represents the half that Juliet had
There we go
How many of you said that same thing to your partners
Excellent
Now we have to look at the next part
She eats 23 of the half
23 of the half
Think are we going to just fold this in half like we did before
No
No
No
Because how much did she eat of this
23
How many parts do we have to fold this into
Show me
Show me
Two folded into three
We need to fold it into three equal parts
equal parts
Good yours should look like mine
How many of you have three equal
How many of you think you know how to shade
Good try it
Give it a shot
Shes going to eat 23 of what she had
Your marks need to go in the opposite direction
You need to fill it out
How many of you have something that looks like this
Does this represent the half of the pizza
Are you going to shade in all three parts
No
Because how much did she eats
23
Yes she ate 23
How much of a whole pizza did she eat
open it up
How much of a whole pizza did she eat
One two three four five six is the denominator
She ate 26 of
Must have been a small  right
Juliets hungry
Yes
Yes
What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell
This is the last thing were going to talk about and then were going to stop
How do you know that this What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell
Use your model while youre talking to your partner
Partner Bs turn to talk first
Ready go
Ready go
Okay back to me
What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell
Oaklee
Sorry can you repeat the question
What is 23 of 12 and how can you tell
23 of 12 is 46
Look at your paperfolding model
26
You dont sound like you believe it
Does your model not show that
It does
When I open my model I see that theres two squares out of the six squares that have doubleshading
Is that not what yours shows
Yes that what mine shows
Okay
How can you tell that its 26
I can tell its 26 because I shaded the opposite way of my other color on two of the and  because were doing six
Theres six squares that we folded  and we shaded
Miss
Yes sir
Yes sir
May I speak to you for a minute
Yes sir
Yes sir
Thank you
No Oaklee
You get to finish
Go for it
Okay
We coloredin lines we did lines the opposite way on two of the boxes
That would be 26 because theres six squares in all
It would be 26
Okay rate how well you understand this paperfolding model
Good because next week youre going to be making some drawings and folding all of this
Should you keep these examples
Yes
Please tuck them inside your math journal and join me on the  for snack and
