to share their thinking
Charlotte come on down for this first one
It seems like Charlotte wants a coach
Who wants to coach her
Charlotte
it means you look at what you have to put in group cells how many groups you put it in and then you put one and one in your group
Im going to pause you
Weve got a fraction here of 12
What part of that fractions boys and girls the numerator or the denominator do we use to put it in groups to know how many groups
On the count of threeSSyoure going to tell me
One two three
One two three
Denominator
Charlotte whats the denominator
Two
Class whats the denominator
Thank you for the active listening thumbs
Whats the denominator
The bottom number
What number is the bottom number
The two
So circle that two for me
All right Skylar continue
Tell her what she needs to do
Put the six in two groups
You need six exits
You circle one
Talk to your partner
Why is Charlotte only circling one group
Actually before you talk ET high five
I want to make sure everybody has a partner
Go ahead
Talk to your partners
All right five four three two and one
Why did she only circle one group Jonas
Because
Charlotte circled one group because
Charlotte circled one group because the denominator is telling us all these two groups and
One half means one out of two
Partner with the longest tiar repeat what I just said
Go
One half means one out of two
All right whats the final answer going to be Charlotte
Three
Go ahead and write that up there
Great
Evelyn come on down
I  and then I circle one group and
All right Emma some active listening comes and I see next one
Aaron
I looked at the denominator and I knew it was three
Aaron when you said you knew it was three
What was it
The denominator
What did that tell you needed three
Three groups
Can you say that in a complete sentence
The denominator told me
The denominator told me that there was three groups
All right great active listening
Thumbs I see a disagreement though and now an agreement are you sure
Carey do you have a question
All right last one
1 2 of 9
Ill take a volunteer for this one
Taylor
I saw the denominator was two
I needed to make two so I needed to make two groups of nine and then there was one extra
I split that in that half and I circled one group and I got a 4 and one 12
Any questions for Taylor
Can you write your final answer up there for me please
When he was counting he could only make two equal groups of eight leaving one left over
He had to split that one in two so that happenedAll right thank you very much
While I am changing the board why do you guys since we had a lovely refresher and someSSwho came up with a great job showing you what and how to do these lets do 15 of 15 15 of 15 and be ready to share with your partner how you did it
Make sure youre writing that final answer
I see a lot of people with work but no answers
Your work looks right but you still need to write the final answer
All right share with your partner
How did you figure that out
Show me your answers please and 15 of 15 should be 3 and thats what Im seeing from pretty much everybody
Great job
Can you please read Nate our target up there
Were going to be moving on today from fractions into decimals but those two things are actually both related
How do you think a fraction and a decimal is related
First lets break that down
What is a fraction
When we are talking about fractions like a fraction of a pizza a fraction of cupcake what does that mean
Go
What is a fraction Violet
Its what  my active listening forms I saw Aaron
Thank you
What do you think a fraction is Skylar
I think a fraction is when you have like a whole number and split it into groups
When you have a whole number and you split it into groups
Okay
Jessica
I think that
Good
A fraction is when you split a whole into smaller equal parts
Nice
Now what do we know about decimals
Thats an example of a decimal up there on the board
You can take a look at that
Whats a decimal
Think for a moment whats a decimal
Share with your partner what you think a decimal is
Partner with a shorter characters go first
Five four three two and one what do you think a decimal is Clara
I think a decimal is definitely
What do you think Shoshanna
Whats a decimal
I think a decimal is
We are right with our place value of decimals with our tens hundreds and thousands but that doesnt really answer the question of what is a decimal
Lets take when do we see decimals in real life
When have you seen a decimal in real life
Think first
Go ahead and share with your partner
Whoever went first last time exhibit
Lets go
Five four three two and one
Byron when did you see decimals in the real world
Store
Where at the store
Can you be more specific than that for me
Say that again
Food aisle
Where in the food aisle
What do you think Leo
Where do you see a decimal
In math
In the real world outside of this classroom in math class
I agree we see them in math but we do things in math to help you out in the real world outside of our classroom
What do you think Delilah
Lets remember our complete sentences
Our both friends are speaking in phrases
We need to speak in complete sentences
I probably would  Where it shows how much it costs
How many of you Thank you for the thumbs up Josie and Taylor
How many of you talked about money with your partner
Except for Josie and Taylor
Money is probably the most common place Were going to put our pencil down please Josie that you see decimals in the real world money
Lets think about whats money
When I have 25 cents what do I have
It is a quarter
Lets think first before we speak out
Youre on the right track
When I have a 25 cents or a quarter what does that mean
What do I have
Go ahead and talk about it
Five four three two one
Josie what do I have when I have a quarter
You have onefourth of a dollar
I have onefourth of a dollar
I like how you converted 25 into a fraction because remember my very original question was what fractions and decimals have in common
If a quarter is onefourth of a dollar and a fraction is pieces of a whole whats a decimal also
What do you think
Lets think about what I just said
Im going to give you a little more think time before we answer
Josie told us Dont worry were going to cap our marker please Blackstar and put it down in front of us because right now were thinking about what Im talking about
Josie said that 25 cents is onefourth of a dollar
and you guys all told me so nicely that fractions are equal parts of a whole equals pieces of something
If 25 cents and one fourth are the same thing that would lead us to think what
Think about what I said before you raise your hand to volunteer
Share your thinking with your partner
Go
Five four three two and one Bailey
I think a decimal is a
Exactly
This is for Ella
I love how she turned and looked at Bailey
If 25 cents is the same thing as a fourth that means a decimal is the same thing as a fraction
If a fraction is part of a whole equal parts of a whole that must mean decimals are also what
Part of a whole
Go ahead and share that with your partner what we just said
A decimal is part of a whole
Share that with your partner
Today were going to be working with decimals
Can you please read our first success criteria Brooke
Okay Julia the next one
Change the decimal into a fraction or the fraction to a decimal
Way back at the beginning when we started our lesson Audrey was telling us that decimals are the place value tenths hundredths and thousandths
Today were going to be working on writing decimals all the way up to the thousands Nate and then weve also just talked about and Bailey told us on how they are Fractions and decimals are really the same thing
If theyre the same thing that means we can do what Josie did and convert a decimal to a fraction
Thats going to be our focus today
Im going to read a number to you right now and youre going to write it on your
Listen carefully
37000124 37124
On a count of three you are going to show it to your partner
If you guys agree do a high five
If you disagree talk it out
See whos correct
Go
On the count of three friends
I said go that was confusing
Confused me too
Get ready
One two three
One two three
Okay
Five four three two and one
Gael can I see your board
This is what you should have written down
37000 the word thousand is a clue
Oops I need a comma
If you have this great job
I noticed some of you were trying to make decimals
Well get there
Theres a special word that hints decimals
If you think back to second third grade fourth grade you might remember that special word or special part of a word
All right
Now on that number I want you to circle the thousands place
Circle the thousands place
On the count of three youre going to tell me what number you circled
One two three
One two three
Seven
All right
Lets do another one a little bit harder
Listen carefully
You dont need that first one anymore
On the count of three youre going to show your partner
If you agree I want to see those high fives friends
I didnt just say that for fun
If you did yes
A lot of people did
Get ready
One two three
One two three
If you disagree talk it out
Lets see here
Look here
Can I see yours
Looking around theres one thing pretty much everybody has but heres our correct answer
Now Id like you to circle the ten thousands digit
Underline the tens digit
Circle the ten thousands
Underline the tens
Circle the ten thousands
Underline the tens
What number did you underline
One two three
One two three
Two
Yes
What number did you circle
One two three
One two three
Three
Good
All right
Now final one
23 and 46 hundredths
23 and 46 hundredths
This is what were doing today
This is going to give me an idea of what you guys already know
I know you cant see that picture very well but thats on purpose
Ill say the number again 23 and 46 hundredths
This time on the count of three youre just going to show me
One two three
One two three
All right
I see a variety of answers which means that youre going to be learning a lot today but I also see something to celebrate with a lot of students
A lot ofSSremembered that the word and meant decimal point
Whenever you see a word written or you hear something written or a number written and you hear that word and the and means decimal point
Paraphrase that with your partner
Go
All right
Im going to be handing these out
Take one pass it around
Everybody has one Jackson grab this stack Owen grab this stack and pass it around
Lets take no more than 20 seconds for everybody to have it
Any extras coming back to me
Right
Everybody have one
Yes
Youve got a stack coming around still
Weve
Is this working
No
I know
Thats fine
Thats why youre sitting up here
All right
Thank you
This square here represents one
What does the square represent boys and girls
One
If this square here represents one whats does the strip represent
I want you to think think think think
Dont tell me
Just think
I dont remember where we were with our partners
Lets just say partner with the shorter hair go first
What does this strip represent
Remember other partner you are going to paraphrase
I agree
I think it means whatever add to or disagree and explain what you think it means
Go
Five four three two one
Savannah what do you think the strip represents if the square is one
sentence
Why do you think that
Because
How many of these little squares would fit in the  All right
I am missing lots of active listening to ones friend
Remember we went over that this morning so it should be fresh in our minds that we need to show our thinking
All right so I agree
This one represents one
This one would be 10
Then think dont talk what does the big square represent
Long hair partner share first and go
Okay five four three two and one
Audrey what do you think
Square C represents a hundred because if we were to draw a line across other digits on  then youd get ten strips and ten squares
All right I see lots of active listening thumbs some that I saw early on
All right so this square would represent one hundredth
Now are these numbers whole numbers or are they decimals
1 10 0100
Youre going to show me your thinking
If theyre a whole number put your arms up big whole
If theyre decimals put your arms little because decimals are part of a whole
So when I say go show me your thinking
Is 1 10 and 100 are they whole numbers or decimals
Go
I see a mixture but I mostly see whole numbers
Lennox explain your thinking
Why do you think its a whole first
I thin its a whole mainly because
So the question was one 10 and 100
Are they whole numbers or decimals
You say whole numbers so why
Because there is no decimal
Okay do we see decimal points
No
No thats a good clue
That was a decimal it probably would need that decimal point
What did we say a decimal was
Remember what Bailey said
Julissa
Thats true but lets think about what Bailey said
Dylan
Its a quarter of a dollar
Thats what Josie said
Remember boys and girls at the beginning of the lesson when we had a fourth is a fraction and 25 cents is a decimal and I asked how are they the same
Talk with your neighbors
See if you can review together what we talked about at the beginning of the lesson
What did we say
We repeated it to each other
