Okay lets get started
Okay someone to tell me how do we write five tenths Regina
You write 05
Excellent
Nine tenths Rosa
9
Seven tenths Colt
70
Any decimals in there
7
Is that all right
Is it okay to have 070
Yes
23 hundredths Jasper what do you write
I wrote 023
Okay
How about three hundredths
Conrad what did you get
I wrote 003
Anyone write 03 for that
Darwin if we wrote 0
Wait hang on I meant Conrad was right
What
I meant Conrad is right
Oh that you were saying Conrad was right
79 hundredths
Ruth what did you write
0 and
Thank you for saying the word and with your decimal because thats what it is
Alright quick maths of one and 19 hundredths Charlie what did you write
I wrote 1 and nine hundredths
You wrote nine hundredths
I wrote 0 and 9 hundredths
0 19 is that what you wrote
No without the one
Without the what
One
Without this one
Yes
You wrote 109
How can we fix this
Daxton
so it be 19 instead
Okay do you see where your mistake was
Alright eight and two tenths
Forest what did you write
I wrote 8 and 2
Alright
The last one 45 and eight hundredths
Kit what did you write
I wrote 450 and 8
Everybody agree
No
Why is it not 458
Darwins
It would then be tenths not hundredths
Okay
Remember that you want your numbers to match the columns
Each column and the place value chart has its own value
This is eight tenths this is eight hundredths
Okay
Once you go further away from the decimal point
Good job you guysAlright looking at your math journal let me put this over we are comparing jugglers to tap dancers
We can see clearly
Oh pretty
All right how are you finding out the cost to hire jugglers
Tell me some math that you did there
Landon what math did you do to figure out how much jugglers cost
I did 3 x 30
Sorry I did 2 x 30 and I got 60
Can you tell me where you go those two numbers
I got 2 x 30 because two hours of entertainment x the cost per performer and then I did that I got 60
I did that x 3 which I got 180
Why did you do that x 3
Because there is three performers
Okay
In our message remember that it said dont forget thats the cost per performer
Good job remembering that you needed to do that for every performer
There were follow me
follow me call me
Okay
Landon said he did 2 x 30 because it was two hours of entertainment at 30 an hour and he got 60
Then he multiplied that x 3 because there were three performers
Did anyone do that in a different way
Grady how did you do yours
First I did 3 x 30 then I did 90 x 2
Okay so you did 30 an hour x the three performers and you got
90
90 and then you multiplied 90 x 2 because they did that for two hours
Yes
Excellent
Did you get 180
Yes
Does it matter what order you multiply this numbers in
No
As long as youre doing the correct multiplication
Are we doing three performers x two hours
No
Would it work
Whats 3 x 2
Six
Whats 6 x 30
180
Oh
6 x 30
Whats 6 x 3
180
So it would work
Okay so that was for jugglers
Now we need to figure out for tap dancers
Someone give me Lee give me number model for tap dancers
33 x 4
Can you tell me why you did 33 x 2
I did for hours  the cost per performer
Oops you wrote the wrong thing
This is just the cost this is the hours
Okay what did you get when you did 33 x 2
I got 66
Okay
Then I did 66 x 6 for the numbers of performers
Okay these are six tap dancers
Then I got 397
Anyone get a different answer or a different way of getting to the answer
Ruth can you talk me through what Lee just did
Can you repeat what she
33 x 2 66
Why did she do 33 x 2
To try and find
33 an hour
Okay and why did she do that x 2
for two hours
They are going to be there for two hours
Then why did she take that and multiply x 6
Because there was
They were six actual tap dancers okay
Now what do we do with that information
Our question asked us how much more would it cost to hire tap dancers than jugglers
What do we do now that we know how much it costs to have a tap dancer and how much it costs to have a juggler
Lou what do you do with those two numbers
You divide them
Divide them
Do you know how to do threedigit division done by threedigit division
I dont I do but I dont as a fourth grader
What do you do with those two totals
Hunter what are you going to do with them
Im going to look at the other number and try and compare how much more it has
When you hear how much more what do you think of in your head
I look at the costs of the bottom for tap dancingand its 396
Then I look at the six and theres six and then on top there is nine so that means it has more so I break down the six
Are you adding subtracting multiplying dividing what are you doing
So Im going to put all numbers that are higher how much is higher than the number
Then thats how much its more
Are you adding subtracting multiplying or dividing to figure out how much more
Dividing
Do you guys know how to do threedigit division by threedigit division
No
When you hear the words how much more
Kolton has nine years I have 45 years
How many more years do I have
How are we going to figure that out
Are you going to add multiply subtract divide
What are we going to do Conrad
Youre going to take two of those assignments and then youre going to subtract
Then soon when you have the answer then you write that down thats how much more
How much more those are clue words
When you subtract youre trying to find the difference between the two numbers
Okay
Youre trying to find the difference
How much more clue word
Clue phrase I should say first subtracting
So Hunter you were telling me you wanted to find the bigger number to start with
I think thats what youre trying to explain is you knew 396 was more than 180 but were going to take that 180 away
If it costs 396 to hire tap dancers and 180 to hire jugglers theyre asking how much more would it cost to hire tap dancers than jugglers
When we subtract that what do we end up with Daxton
21600
Its 216 more to tire tap dancers than it is jugglers okay
Youre going to do lots of multistep not only without talent but also with food
Okay so lets look through and read through the questions
You can you erase your whiteboard
Make sure your math journal is open
Thank you Silvia for being ready  for being ready
Thanks boys for being ready
All right the principal has several questions for Ian and Sarita about what they learned
Help them answer the principals questions
Okay
Were going to do estimates as well
Were going to do this first one together and then Im going to see if you can help describe what we did
If you can ask questions to clarify if you are confused then Im going to have you solve one and explain to me how you did it and then Ill let you do the other one on your own
All right number one will you please read this to me Scarlet
How much more would it cost to hire the tumblers than the singing group
So what two groups are we comparing
Tumblers and singing group
Yes tumblers and singing group
So Im going to have to scooch that back down
Singers how much do they cost per hour
10800
16 an hour how long do they perform
Three hours
How many people are in their group
Four
Were going to do a number model with an unknown
What three numbers are we going to multiply together for the singing group
Frankie what three numbers do you think were going to multiply together for the singing group
30
Look at your chart carefully the singing group
16 four
Whered you get the four
Number of performers
Since there are four people in their group okay
Then what am I going to multiply that total by
Three
By three because
Hours of entertainment
they will perform for three hours okay
So thats one way to do it
Is there a different way to do it
Jasper whats a different way
You could do 4 x 3  12
Then you multiply 12 x 16
Okay
Is there even another way to do that
Yes
Lee what would be the third way
You could use 30 x 16 x 4
Yes
So were going to do an estimate
Whats an easier number to work with besides 16
20
20 is definitely easier
We know a very simple factor of 20 times four and then we can multiply that times three
What is 20 x 4
80
So that would be 80
Whats 80 times 3
200
Whats eight times three
24
24 but its not 24 ones its 24 tens so our answer should be close to 240 for the singing group
Okay thats only one part of our problem
We have to compare that to tumblers
Hunter how much do tumblers cost
Tumblers cost 22
22 an hour times how many hours
Times three
Then how many people are in their group
Eight
Times eight
Okay
So lets do an estimate for the tumblers
22 isnt as friendly a number as 20
We could do 20 X 3 we know that very easily
Whats that
60
Then we can multiply that times eight
We know our basic factor of six times eight
48
48 but its not 48 ones its 48 tens
Okay
So whos going to cost more
The tumblers
The tumblers
When we subtract were going to want to make sure that our tumblers number will come first because they will cost more
Are we subtracting our estimate
No
So our estimates going to be 480  240 which is 240
Because 24  24  48 but thats not what were looking for
Were looking for the real cost
Okay
Anyone able to do 16 x 4 quickly
No
Hunter what is it
64
It is 64
Youre right good multiplication very quick
Are we done with singers
64 X 3
We have to do 64 x 3
Anyone able to do that quickly
Daxton
192
It is 192 is the total cost for singers
192 make sure we label
Lets figure out how much it is for tumblers
What s 22 x 3
66
Thats 66
We have to do that x 8
Anyone able to do 66 x 8 quickly
528
How much
528
You got it Daxton good multiplication
528
I may let you use calculators for the actual multiplication today since these are very big numbers
We have to find how much more it would cost to hire tumblers than the singing group
What are we going to start with
What are we going to do to find the answer to that
Cher do you know
How are we going to find the total cost or the total difference how much more it will cost
Subtraction
What am I going to start with
528
Im going to do 528 Im going to subtract
192
192
Come on mathematicians
897
How much more will it cost
Cher do you know it
333
Youre close
326
Collins say it
326
326 more to hire the tumblers than the singers
Raise your hand if you were able to at least follow the steps that we needed to do to get to our answers
You might need more time on the multiplication
We just had our quick multipliers help us out
Your job right now is to look at number two but now were moving to food
We are going to make your tummy growl
Okay we are going to find out how much would it cost to buy the burritos and the sandwiches
When you hear the word and what are you doing
Addition
Youre adding
Youre going to add okay
Look at your chart notice that were going to do burritos there are eight burritos in a package youll need 13 packages and theyre 3 each
Same steps okay
Then the sandwiches are five per package you need 18 packages and theyre 6 each
You are going to solve number two in whatever steps make sense to you
When you are finished give me a thumbs up
You may start working on your math
You are going to have to explain to me how to go through this number two problem okay
Solve it when youre done thumbs up and you may flip and start working on
Were going to do number two and then Im going to let you work on number three and then try this in partners but because we are recording your mathematical thinking Im going to let you go through problem number two
See how you can solve it not how I can
If you need a calculator for the multiplication part but you have to show your work
You still have to know what steps to take and you have to show what youre doing
You can grab a calculator
I have a calculator
I already have a calculator
It doesnt turn off
Its on at all the times
Mine shuts off
You have to raise your hand
Show her how you finished
Thats the ones
Okay Ill be waiting for you to explain
This is your 3 and this is your sandwiches but you only gave me your sandwiches total
Im sorry
Oh just kidding
Lets find
5  3 so how does your answer start with the  Make sure you put the label on it
What is that
Okay Ill be ready for you there explain in just a few minutes
Alani youre welcome to start
Were on this oneThats how we are doing its just this problem tight here
You only have one thing here
Youre doing burritos and sandwiches
burritos 180
You multiplied 18 x 13 x 3
Im supposed to do eight in front
Yes
Thats what we were doing up here
You were playing attention and following well
You should have burritos and sandwiches Frank
Okay keep doing your math boxes
Have you figured out your burritos
burritos  Do subtracting
No
Can you take a big number away from a small number to even begin with
No
Okay so think about what you need to do to
Make sure you have your dollar sign
That makes more sense
Put the dollar sign  and its dollars
Good Job
Okay then make your box
Okay  trying to  how you solve this
Those of you who are struggling through listen really carefully to your classmates and how they walk you through how to solve this
When youre explaining if I call on you please tell us why youre using specific numbers
If you say said I did 13 x 3 please tell me why you did 13 x 3
Okay
Are you ready
Im going to turn my microphone off so that we can hear you not me
Miss  is trying to find you again
All right Lee
For the burritos I did should I start with my estimates or my
Lets do the actual number model first and then you could talk us through your estimates and then talk us through how you solved it
I wrote 13 x 3 because of the numbers of packages needed and the cost per item
Okay so they were 3 per
Yes
Then they were 13 per package
Is this burritos or sandwiches
Burritos
Okay
Okay
Im going to put a little dollar sign right next to the three so that Ill remember that thats the money okay
What else did you do
Then you do x that you do x 8
Why
Because the numbers of pieces I get is per package
There are eight burritos in a package okay
Then from my estimate I did 10 x 3 because 10 was the  number
Okay
That
Lee So I did 10 x 3 is 30
I did that x 8  240
Burritos cost about 240 approximately
What did you do next
Then I went to sandwiches
I did 18 x 6 because of the number of packages needed and the cost per item
Okay so there were 18 sandwiches per package 6 each
I did that x 5
Because
Because of the items per package
Oh so we needed 18 packages theyre five sandwiches
Then from my estimate I did I rounded the 18 to 2020 x 6 then x 5
x 5  600
Its about 600 for sandwiches
Wow did you see that
My pen just randomly marked up there
Can you see that
Yes
There is a ghost in the house
Aliens in the classroom
Okay great
Were done with our estimate
Raise your hand if you did a different way of finding your estimate
Lillian how was estimate different
I did my estimate of doing 5 x 8
5 x 8
Where did you get five
I got the five from the three because it was close to five
Oh so youve rounded your three to be a five since it was a friendlier number
Then I did  x 13 and that equals the number of  Then with the sandwiches I did 5 x 5
You rounded your six to be a five instead
Yes
Then did that x 18
Yes
Okay
Did you come up with a very similar number if you add 600 and 240 together
Yes I got 840
We forgot that step didnt we Lee
We needed to add the cost of our sandwiches to the cost of our burritos
Really we would be doing 600  240  840 about
Jasper did you do something different
You had your hand up earlier for doing something different
Did you just do them in a different order
Three estimates
Mine was estimated but I did get the answer with that
You got something similar
From my own answer I got 852
We havent gone to the answer answer yet
Just for your estimate
Oh
Were simply doing estimates so far
Answer
Take your calculator push clear switch it on
Were going to follow these steps that Lillian gave us
Please type in 13 x 3 x 8
You should get 312 is that correct
Yes
Thats good
If we follow the steps that Lee gave us we are going to do 18 x 6 x 5 then push
540
540
You may keep your 540 there push  312
85200
85200
Was our estimate close to our total
Yes
Cool right
All right you may pick number three or number four to do with a partner
Then you are way above and beyond where you need to be in
If you decide to move make your microphone go with you somewhere
You need to do problem three or four with a partner
Calculators are fine
Wait do we take the microphone
Only if youre going to work somewhere else
Oh okay
Come on Collin
You want to go
Yes lets go to my chair
Daxton do you want toYou want to work somewhere else
No yes
Cut between
Lets do it
1
Lets turn to the page its 188
So should we do three or four
If you wanted the tap dancers
It doesnt matter lets just do one
No lets just do four
If we wanted tap dancers to perform for six hours how much would it cost
Wait tap dancers lets look at the chart
Theyre six oh I get it you need to multiply 2 by 3
Im literally doing
with that cost so you would have to be  You have to do this
I know but there is 33 in there
Youd have to double that
That is the tap dancers at the bottom
We have changed that to this
Okay math boxes
Lets do
The estimates
I already did
Yes
That is 360
Next problem is if we wanted to serve only burritos youd need three times as many packages as the numbers indicated in the table
How much would that cost
Its division
If we wanted to serve only burritos we would need three times as many packages as the numbers stated in the table
How much would that cost
If we wanted to serve only burritos we would need three times as many packages as the number stated on the table so the number stated on the table is 13
We do  x 3
We do that on the calculator that would be 13 x 3 x 3  117
Hold on we have to do the number model with that number
Why dont we just we do this without the answers then we come to write the answers from all these
Yes youre right
Which angle shows W X Y
I dont do this
How many of you are doing problem number four
Already did
Dont forget you have the total cost for burritos on problem number two
You can rewrite that then do a 3
To try this is also known as number five if we added all the performers and wanted to give them each a sandwich as a snack how many packages of sandwiches would we need for the performers
If they hired all the performers that would mean you would do 3  4  8  6 which is 21
That would 21
There are 35 colored pencils in a basket
There are 35 colored pencils in a basket 13 in a box
How many will each one get
Wait we dont know what were using
Oh whats 35  13
Ms Glen do you have to do this try this
So we need to do 3   3
Two more minutes
Oh no
Wait
Equals eight
Oh zero
Yes the next one is zero
Yes but thats  8 x 5  that
Its 1   8
Do that on your calculator 1   8
They want him to perform for six hours and normally they perform for two hours
Wait I know what to do with this
Its 36
We can do this though this may take a little bit of time
We can do 8 x 13 which is 104 x 3  312 then we do the 32
Okay
Oh wait no we need to find 36 on the board
No yes
8 x 13  104
104 x 3  312
312 x 3  936
8 x 13  104
104 x 3  312 x 3  936
Oh wait wait stop I think I know if we do like this its one
Its one it has to be
I know
Ill go get my calculator
Can you put my calculator on
All right guys
Thank you for
Yes
I wrote 33 x 6 because it says that they wanted for the 6 it says they wanted 6 and 32 from the tap dancers
I made that second to the two
I put 33 because it costs 33 per hour
Then I found that
I cant remember how much that was and then I
Get the calculator someone Andy
33 x 6
198
198 then I did times 6 again and then I
Why did you pick another six
Because there are six numbers of performance six people in it
Theyre now equal 1188
People dollars what do you use
Dollars
You dont have to do
Okay
If you did number three doublecheck your work
Any questions on that
Cecilia thank you for telling why you used those numbers for each person
Number four
Jasper you have to be a little patient
Erase all these
Can you tell Cecilia thank you for being great and explaining
Thank you Cecilia
All right Jasper
All right if we only wanted to serve burrito we would need three times as many packages as the numbers we have on the table
Tell me what you did for your unknown
The unknown that we did mean that the 312 x 3
Where did you get 312
I got 312 by how much I remembered
From problem what
Number two
From problem number two we already found out how much burrito cost right
We knew 312 was the cost of burritos but then why did you use times three
Because it said we would need three different people to have this
Its 300 x 3
It will be
how did he go
Whats 300 x 3
300 x 3 is 900
Whats 10 x 3
10 x 3 is 30
What is 2 x 3
2 x 3 is 6
900  30  6 equals how much
Equals 936
Now can you remember that youve already done a problem and you know how to resolve it
Okay thank you Jasper for being the one to talk us through that
Any questions on either of those
Your homework is very much the same thing
Youre going to look through your problems in your chart all the work there and the problem
When you leave make sure you grab your homework
