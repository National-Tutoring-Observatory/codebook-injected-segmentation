All right
Thank you
Is there anything about the homework that needs
Fabulous
How well you were able to complete fraction problems independently last night for your homework
Team four were waiting for you
Thank you
Good job you guys
Way to go because you didnt use that knowledge today and apply it in some more work
Im glad youre feRogeng successful
Can you please stand up in the center of your team
Before we start today were going to do the stray
Hey who would like to stray
If you are person one in your team gather up all of your math things and stray person one thank you
Okay where are we
There we go
Thank you nice
It always feels good how people call you out
Its like
Lets have person number three please
You are  Hudson
Thank you
Awesome
Now we have our brand new team awesome
encouraging one another
Lets start with  today
You are going to round numbers
So were going to  you can see it
Does that help
Round 873 to the nearest whole number
And flash
Way to go everybody is saying 87
Thats the next largest whole number  were rounding to the next whole number thats right here
Round 9912 to the nearest tenth
And flash
Way to go people are saying 991
Ill have you explain your thinking about that rounding to your face partner
Partner A please explain yourself
Raise your hand if youre partner A
Thank you
That would be people one and three
You are explaining to your face partner how you rounded that
Ready
Go
Go
Round 318 to the nearest tenth
And flash
Way to go everybody say that number
32
Way to go
Were done
Lets go to another one
Round 715 to the nearest tenth
And flash
Okay everybody say this
72
Why is it 72
Hudson
Its 72 because if we look at the five five or more you have to round up
So youre
What five or more What place value are you talking about
You got to start real sequential
What place value do I look at
Im looking at the hundredths place and its a five so you have to round
Why do you have to round up if its a five
Oh
I was looking at the tenths place and then if you look to the hundredths place you know that you have to round up because five or more
Why does five or more raises forward
So anything coupling in between you round up to the next place value
I knew that you would round off the one in the tenths place will become a two so it will be 72
Thank you
Much more specific way to go Hudson
72 by this one
Read the number with me
Round
882186 to the nearest hundredths
And flash
Its partner Bs turn to explain
That would be person two and person four explain to your partner
Thank you
Try this oneRound 78005 to the nearest hundredth
Flash
Way to go
Nice job if you rounded that to 78
Round 0055 to the nearest tenth
Flash
Thank you
Way to go
Who says 01
You read this one with me
98137 to the nearest thousandths
In flash
Good
Lets read that rounded number now
9814
Now
Round 5009 to the nearest tenth
Flash
If you said five youre on the right track
I see some people that are writing 51
What are those people doing incorrectly
What is somebody doing if they wrote 51
If youre the one that wrote 51 you go first at your team and explain
If you dont have anybody at your team that did that mistake just pick somebody to explain what they did
Rate how well you are rounding to specified places today
Thank you
The relevance of rounding
Whats the purpose of doing this
Roge
The purpose of doing this is if you had to estimate something you could round that up to make an estimate
You know the meaning of rounding up right
Or rounded up
We could just use the word round right
Rounding helps us estimate
Estimates help us do what
Why make an estimate Andrea
Because it helps you add or subtract better
In what ways
Because they could be equivalent
I dont understand what you mean
It could be equivalent
What do you mean
Like it couldnt be easier because itd be closer to a number
Okay if you round a number you can get a mental idea
Just a general idea of a number
Good point
Sometimes you do that
Youre just rounding to estimate
Im still lining the shelves in my kitchen
I decided last night I dont think I have enough shelf lining
I have to order more again from Amazon to finish lining it
I made an estimate
I didnt go to measure directly I rounded off
Well youre going to need three more rolls of this
What would be another reason that we want to make an estimate
Vicki
Probably to
Bump a friend
Get somebody to help you
They dont have to have their hand up
Pick somebody that you think will know why we make an estimate
Finish your thinking
River was pretty much sure and she didnt let you finish
I think that threw you
Youre solving a problem thats kind of big
You make an estimate because
Yes youre totally on the right track
You solve a problem you want to check through reasonable limits
Exactly thank you
Lets try a math message here
Youre going to complete problems one and two on journal page 169
Look carefully at your answer and then finally talk to your partner about what you noticed
First you work independently
Then you look carefully
Then you talk to your partner about what you noticed
Yes
Yes
All right
Were going to go over the learning intention
You guys will help Mr Oliver today right
Yes
Can we go over this piece of vocabulary before we do the learning intention
This is what we were talking about yesterday at the very end of math
Unit practice
I dont  some fractional number but okay
Its a number written as a fraction where the numerator is one and the denominator is a positive integer
Look at these examples
What do you notice about all the examples
They all have a one in the numerator right
That means its a unit
One unit is one in the numerator because its 12 its 14 its 17 its 116
Smoked chocolate here
Face partner what is the unit fraction
Ready go
All right
What is a unit fraction
I love the graphics on this because theyre really good
That helps you
What is a unit fraction Charlie
A unit fraction its a fraction thats got one unit
Its usually got one is the numerator
If youve got a whole were using 14 as an example
If you take 14 thats one unit as a whole
Love your explanation
You want to come to our team planning and help us write these
Nice job
Thank you
Lets now transition to our learning intention for today
Real quickly
I can discuss and apply strategies for multiplying fractions by whole numbers
Discuss
Give me a gesture
Yes you can talk I see some people
Great acting over there Margo thank you
Youre going to talk about it and youre going to apply strategies
What does a strategy mean Asher
A strategy like a way of doing things
Like the way youve explained that
Youre going to have a way of doing something
To multiply fractions show me that
This by whole numbers today
Yes a whole number
Is there going to be a fraction with it
Is it going to be a mixed number
No
Yesterday we were multiplying fractions by fractions
Today were going to be multiplying by whole numbers for typical learning intentions
This is how youre going to know youre successful
When you can apply one of the strategies
Because were going to talk about a couple today in order for you to solve some problems
Okay
Did you finish your math message
Yes
Did you talk with your partner
Im going to have you talk with your partner about your work
Let me give you one minute
Okay what are your strategies
What is one strategy
For problem one I should say specifically
Im sorry
I was too vague
I apologize for interrupting you
What was your strategy for problem one
You want to finish your explanation
What do you think of his thinking
When I heard your thinking I was thinking of when we put the calendars under the document camera and show the groups of five 15 broken into five groups
Thank you
That was definitely one strategy
Who has a different strategy than that
Whats another strategy Roge
The strategy I used was I would do 5 15 and 5 20
Since I know my math facts I know that 5 315
So thats the strategy I used
You want to connect to that Margo
I agree with
I would love to add on
Kind of like proving the problem backwards in a way
Because you have your number 2 15 and then you getting your answer
You technically multiplying your answer by 15
Here
Youre just kind of going backwards moving out to the end
I think youre noticing what were supposed to be talking about
What do you notice and thats what youre noticing
Its the same thing
But just showing you two different ways of doing it right
Yes
Imagine I gave you another in number will the outnumber be the same for both labels
Ill give you another in number
Do the same for both
Why or why not
Its time to talk with your shoulder partner please
Ready
Go
Go
Roge would it be the same for both
Me and my partner said it would be the same
Because youre doing the same
Im going to let Rebecca help you with the explanation
She was doing a great job explaining it but then youre going to explain it after you hear her explain it
Okay
Lets have Rebecca go for first
Well I think it would be the same
Because multiplying it by 15 is pretty much the same as dividing it by five
Because youre splitting the larger number into five equal groups
Yes
Thats why theyre both the inner
Yes
Very clear
Now you get a chance to say that
Its the same as saying 15
Multiplying by 15
by five youre just breaking it into five different parts
Well done thank you
Hold on a second here
Whats the division rule that we learned earlier this year when we were talking about division
I showed you this and we talked about it as division
What was that division role
I see some people going
They dont remember
Raise your hand if you remember that division role
Go ahead
Talk at your teams
People that remember go first
Thank you
If youve talked about it this would be 1 5
The numerator divided by the denominator
Thats another way of thinking about this
All right the numerator divided by the denominator
What if I have this 23 I dont like that
Hold on
I dont want to get that big
Lets say 85 No I dont want to say that either
Sorry
Im not good at coming up with these off the top of my head
Hold on
I want to do one that you can see really easily I saw an example when I was reading through the lesson that was really helpful
What if I have 274
What would that be
Do it on your slate
Express your remainder as a fraction
274
Class remember express your answer
Oh goodness we have some interesting ideas here
Save your answers
Im gonna put something on the board
I have 6 34
Hold your answers
I have people that just wrote the equation like this
I said to solve it
I have somebody had said 6 14 and somebody that says 5 34
I want you to talk about these with your teams please
Ready
Of those hopefully  6 34 is the correct answer
The person that got 5 34 looks like they probably just divided incorrectly more than likely
Same with the person with 6 14 they didnt really put the right remainder
Then the person that says 274 they set up the problem but they didnt actually solve it
Im just reminding you of this division rule all right
When you see a fraction you can also think about it as division
All right
Look at the rules for problem three and four again
Wow we havent even done that
Hold on
Where am I disconnected here
Look at problems three and four on your page
Examine the rules for problem three and four
The in numbers are the same for both
Do you see that
Do you think these rules will produce the same out numbers
Why or why not
Talk with your shoulder partner
If youre a team of three make sure youre rotating sharing going on please
Talk with your shoulder partner
Do you think the out numbers will be the same
Why or why not
Is the strategy going to be What have I asked you
Sorry
Do you think these rules will produce the same out number
Why or why not
Jodie
because we think it would be because 15  15 would be the same thing as 1 divided by 5  35 would be the same as 3 divided by 5
Thank you
I see somebody wants to add on
Thank you
Relate yesterdays work to problem three
What did we do to solve problem three yesterday
The other partner turned their  first
What did we do yesterday to solve problems like one and number three
Ready
Go
Go
What was the strategy we used yesterday to solve problems like number three
Andrew
What we did is we used a unit fraction to find Just to find the regular one and then we did times the numerator so we can see if 35 of 15
I agree I just dont like the part about the regular one
What do you mean by regular one
I mean like when you do the whole number times the unit fraction is kind of like
Youre finding the product of    15 and then multiplying that times 3 because you have three of those
Maybe thats just some finetuning of vocabulary
I get that rule
I need to talk about it some more
Youre going to write down the two strategies
Weve talked about two strategies
Bradategies
Think of fraction problems that was yesterdays work
Writing that strategy we just talked about
Then today interpreting the fraction as division
Thats what we just talked about also
Those are the two different rules
You can work as a team to come up with the explanation
You have four minutes to do this
Ready
Go
Go
My bad
You probably should solve questions three and four to help you come up with a strategy
If you solve the problems itll help you word the strategy
especially for strategy two
I feel like strategy one I  but not number two
Make sure you get problems three and four
find the denominator
See how many groups and the denominator can go into  whole number and  Yes
number 15 x 3 45 divided by five is
All right
Lets talk about strategy one
Id like somebody to   lots of people willing to explain that strategy and throw it under there
Thank you
Yes the written
Theres people that are like this
divide the  number
Are they always going to be  the numbers
Are they always going to be remember our learning intention is dividing whole numbers by fractions or multiplying
Were dividing  multiply
Thats why Im confused
Were multiplying whole numbers by fractions
Youre going to divide the whole number by I cant read it
Are you going to divide it by a rule
What part of the fraction are you going to divide it by
What part of that fraction
The numerator
Lets try it
15 divided by three is three and then
Yes because youre really dividing to find the whats that vocabulary word
Youre diving to find the unit fraction
Youre trying to find what 110 is
When you divide by 5 youre finding what 110 is
Id like you to move
Find a new place
New team
Find what 15 is and then what do you do once you find what 15 is
Show me
What do you do once you find what 15 is
Multiply by
By the numerator right
Good try Marvin
Way to be up there and trying
Im very proud of you
Who else would like to throw their rule under there
Hopefully its something we can read because that was really hard to see
Thank you Jodie
Can you take yours under please
Thank you
the whole number
We want to say you divide the whole number
Divide the denominator of the rule then you take that number and multiply it by the numerator
I feel like its better but it still has some things
What are something Shes done a good job but what are some tweaks
Whats something that you could ask her
Is it always going to be a rule number
No
Whats it going to be
Its going to be like the thing youre multiplying it by
Whats the thing that were multiplying by today
Fractions
Fractions changing the world rule by the denominator of the fraction then take that number and multiply it by the numerator of that fraction
Do you see your three fix ups
Yes
All right
Round of applause
Nicely done
I see several people that dont have the second part finished
Please finish that after you see other peoples examples
All right
Who can explain the strategy to the second one
They have it written out
Way to go
Lets see yours Andrea
Way to go
Youre gonna get an idea for looking at someone elses work
Can you fill it in from seeing that
Yes
Yes
Should your math journal be open
Should you be looking at yours to see Gosh am I making sense
I see Jodie there modifying hers based on the feedback
Thats what Im asking people to do
Look at your work and modify as needed
They said multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator
Can you move it up so we can see it too and read it
No there you go
Close getting better
There you go
Now read it again
Multiply the whole number by the numerator and then by the denominator
Shes got parts of this definitely right
She has parts
Good job using vocabulary but theres some feedback
Call on people that are trying to give you some feedback
Multiply the whole number by the numerator
You dont agree with that
Shes saying Can you move it down a little bit so we can see the example and your strategy
Lets try it
15  3 is 45 times 5
Gosh I cant do that one in my head
That would be like 50  5
That would be
Yes is that really what you mean
Multiply the whole number by the numerator of the fraction and then by the denominator of the fraction
the denominator
She figured it out
Yay good job
Way to go
Thats awesome
Especially scary when youre up at the front in the camera
Way to go Andrea
Way to keep your composure
Then the same the numerator of the fraction
Everybody have the rule written down now
Yes
You are going to look at page 170 please
Look at 13
No number one
Theres a 13 in it
Read the directions for A with me
Solve the problem by thinking about 23 of 13
Show your work
That could be computation
Could it be a drawing
Yes
Yes
Which strategy is that that we were just writing about on the previous page
Show me
Is that strategy one or strategy two
Thats strategy one its what we were doing yesterday
Now read B
Solve the problem by thinking about 23 as 2 divided by 3
Show your work
That could also be computation
Could it be a picture
Possibly
Youre working with your partner
When you are finished go to math boxes
Dont keep going on this page
I want to look at this work
Yes
Yes
Shoulder partner obviously
Its kind of hard to do drawings and stuff together across the table
Working with your shoulder partner or your trio
Do problem one then go to math boxes
Ready
Go
Go
Go to the picture to show that
Were going to have some people throw their work under here lets have someone that made a picture for 1A
Who made a picture they can show us
Good lots of volunteers
Marcus
Way to go
Are we looking at our work
No were looking at hers and were thinking about it
Were thinking hard
I used the strategy number one
This is actually B your answer is for B
This is the answer for B where youre showing thinking about it as division
Im going to have you save this for now okay
You can come back up way to go for B you got that
You need some idea for A
Who made a picture for A thank you
Lets go Margo
Thank you
I know that the strategy number one  how to divide and then you have to multiply
First I thought how many times can three go into 13 and we got fourtime and that was
Then we have one whole leftover
We also have 13 we have 4 and 13
Then you multiply that by two because youre getting 23 instead of just 13 of 13
Then I got my answer 8 and 23
Im  you guys all seem to get it but Im struggling Im trying
Yours is very similar to what I did with them but can you explain it again
Im sorry
Youre confused too
Go again those of us that are  more time can look at it
First I know that I had to put the whole number by the denominator of the fraction
I was able to split it into four whole groups
No I dont see how thats four whole groups
If you divide it into three because that would be the denominator of the fraction
You would have three
I see the three groups as the three columns
Yes
Theres four in each group of three
Yes and each one of these would be part of
Can you show us the three groups
This is one group
Good
Thank you
Two groups and three groups
Thank you
Then for each group you would have a third with the group as well
Thats the 13th one
Yes
Thank you
Then put two of those you would have eight thats eight full  and then two thirds
Now your picture makes way more sense to me
I did not understand it the way you had it before unfortunately Im sorry but that was very clear
Round of applause beautiful
Now lets let Marcus go up and show us because she had strategy two up there for strategy one
Thats the strategy one where you find the unit fraction and multiply it by the numerator because you had 23 not just 13
Nice job
Now Marcuss explaining the division part
I used strategy one and divided the whole number by three as the denominator of the fraction
That was
Do you want to go back figure this out and come back
I know you know what youre doing Im seeing that but I know
Can we pause this and come back to it and just finish this one problem then tomorrow
Are guys okay with that
Yes
Thank you
Were going to go to the library
Just understand today when we go to the library we
