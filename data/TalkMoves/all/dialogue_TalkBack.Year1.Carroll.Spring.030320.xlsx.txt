All right for math today our learning target is the lesson is area models for fraction multiplication
So I can use area models to find fraction products
What does product mean in math Olivia
Answer to a multiplication
Answer to a multiplication problem
So I know I understand this when I can draw a large square divide it horizontally by one denominator and vertically by the other denominator
Okay we did that yesterday
Shade the parts of the square for each fraction and show the part that is shaded by both fractions and write a number sentence that shows the area model
So basically what we did yesterday
It is similar we may have to look at some tips
Oh whoops or a nine
That was yesterdays
How did
Yes we did 57 so
Yes thats right
23 of 23 So if we were to do that like we did yesterday so lets just draw
Ill have somebody come up
We need two different colors
Lets start with just a black box
Somebody come and show me 23
Laim
Do you want me to
No I just want you to do 23 so you are just drawing one of them
So Laim is deciding to do his vertically
Emma are you paying attention do I need to move you two so youre not so close
Okay
Do we agree or disagree with what Laim put up here for 23
I agree
I agree
Okay
So can I have somebody come draw another 23 in a different way
Oliver you want to try it
Sure
Lets pick a different color
Miss Carroll why would you do those four lines
Just like
We did this yesterday you werent here yesterday but this shows us 23 of 23
When we have two colors and they have xs that tells us the answer
So Elijah what is the answer of 23 of 23
Im still confused a little
Okay
Who can
Sophia
46
So we have 1234 that have both red and blue in them
So thats our numerator
Im just going to write it on this side
And then Sophia said six 123456
Not quite
Its nine
Nine
Its nine because we want the total of all of the boxes
So Sophia I think you were looking at just the six we used that just had blue and red in them somewhere
But we want to look at 123456789
So the answer to 23 of 23 is 49
Right
The activity on card 65 let me look at that and see I forgot to bring that out
I want you to talk at your teams which would produce a larger product 12 x 13 or 12 x 15
Discuss that in your team come up with an answer which one and then how do you know
Okay so if you have to solve it whenever you have to do as a team come up with which ones larger
Team One which one did you come up with
Im going to put tick marks by what each team says
We came up with 12 x 13
So you think this ones bigger
Yes
Because
Oh yes tell me why
if you look at it and you solve the problem it would be 16
But if you do 12 of a 15 it would be 110 and a 16 has a bigger fraction than
Okay
Team Two which one did you pick
We picked 12 x 13 and we picked it because if you do 12 x 13  16  or when you solve the problem you do that
Then also when you solve the problem for 12 x 15 it would  110 which is like Oliver said smaller than 16
If you have 16 of the pie you have more than if you had 110 of the pie
Team Three what did you pick
We got 12 x 13
Why did you pick that one
Probably the whole team said 12 x 13
So I just did the problem to make sure and
And this team
We did 12 x 13
Same one
What was your reasoning
Because
Team 2 can you listen to Team 4 like they listened to you
We did the problem and we found out that it was the 16 and then 4  3 is
Okay
Team Five which one did you pick
12 x 13
Because we ust kind of estimated 13 is bigger than 13 and 12  12 and so if you look at this  13 is bigger than
Okay
So in this card what youre going to do is youre going to come up with five different problems in your team
So if you have five people each person could come up with one
These teams that have six if you want to go to a team that doesnt have five to make up your problem you can but youre making it up using these fractions and you can only use these and you cannot have the same problem more than once
Let me find where it said okay youre using halves so you could use one half
Were not going to use two halves
You can use thirds so you could use 13 or 23 youre going to use fourths so you could use 14 24 is the same as a half so we re not going to put it 34 or you could use fifths 15 25 35 45 okay
Let me see if theres anything else
No thats it
Okay so what youre doing lets say Im part of this team you guys are going to have this card
Number one I would say my problem is going to be 35 x 23 thats my problem
We have to find one of these squares that we can use its going to be divided in fifths and its going to be divided in thirds to show our work
It has to have that five and three or something
Yes
Let me see if not then I m going to flip it over and draw it
Okay so lets see fifths one two three four no
One two three four five so this one has five and no its divided into one two three four five
Thats five and five
Not necessary
No there isnt so I may have to flip it over or I may have to take off some boxes to make it work
Yes I may have to draw extra or take some off
All right draw it
Ive realized that we ve only done this with fractions can we use whole numbers
Yes
We will do that but lets not jump ahead
Your math message yesterday was 23 of 24 remember  of  means what
Multiply
Means to multiply
All right Im going to give you your sheet each person come up with a problem and then solve it and see if as a team youve come up with the same answers for each problem
We each should have five problems
Yes
Right here at the top theres a place to put five problems
Can the team with six people come to
Yes if you have six maybe go join another team so you can create a problem for them
Got it
Okay two things you need a something that youre siting by and right now if youre in groups of five and somebody needs to go be with a different partner then you can do that but you need one computer for the two of you
Be with somebody of your team unless somebody is left out
Im out
Ill go wait
Sophia  with your partner
Go into google and with your partner first quiz Who Wants to be a Millionaire
Okay about two more minutes
Is it two
Two more minutes
All right
Im going to ask that you switch gears and  partner
Okay if were going to have time to play cahoot I need you to switch gears
Were going to play again right
Yes
What do we do
Were going to play again
Team
Youre doing it with a partner
Daylen you better get busy with your partner
Okay Im about ready to cancel this
This is way too loud
Okay five four three two one
Isabelle
I feel like Im missing one person
Anyone thats playing too loud Im going to ask you to close your computers and youre going to be done
Did everybody answer
No yes
Hey you saw a half of it colored and then onethird
Okay
If you count here theres one out of how many and then three out of how many
Were getting good
Its up there
Another true or false
red
I havent figured it out yet
True or false
Think about it
The denominator tells you how many boxes you have total
Okay last one
What What
What
Last one
Were going to win anyway
All right
The last thing that youre going to do silently on your own is page 177 number 2 and number 3
Okay
Two and three
You can put your computer away and youre silently working on number two and number three
