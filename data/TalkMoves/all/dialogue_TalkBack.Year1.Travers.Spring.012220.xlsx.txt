All right
My friends were going to start out with just getting our math brains warmed up today with mental math
Does everybody have a whiteboard a marker and a way to erase
Yes
All right Im going to show you a decimal
Id like you to write it in expanded form
When you think about expand does your brain go that means Im going to  stretch it out into the different parts of the number right
Okay here we go
Lets read this decimal together
Lets read this decimal together
Ready
Go
Go
Fortyone and eight tens
All right
Please write that in expanded form
After we do one I know you will say Oh yes
All right think about what would the 40 look like the one and the eight tens
Now another thing that I asked my classes to do that might be similar or different to Miss Kay is I say three two one show and you show me your whiteboard so that I can get a sense of the thinking that you have on your whiteboard
Is that the same thing
Okay ready
Three two one show
Just to make sure my friends because I have old eyes make sure I can see your decimal
If you have a decimal dont make it so tiny that its just like  I need to be able to see it from across the room
Ross will you share with us what you have on your board please and hold it up so we can see it
Talk us through it
I started with forty and then I added a one and then I added eight tens
Hold it up so we can see it please
My friends Id like for you to show a hand signal
Excellent
Thank you
Hands down
All right well do a couple more to get our brains warmed up
Lets read this decimal together
Lets read this decimal together
Ready
Go
Go
Fifty and thirteen hundreds
Awesome
Now thinking show me in expanded form
This time Im behind you
When you hold up your board Ill see it back here
Three two one show
Excellent
Jayden would you keep yours up high and share your thinking
I started with fifty added fifty and since theres of inserting nothing in the ones I dont have to do anything there
Then for tens I put a decimal point and one and then for hundreds I did a decimal point a zero and a three
Okay Id like to see your hand signals please
Fifty whole plus onetenth plus three hundreds
Three claps for Jayden
Thanks
Who also I need to give three claps to Ross
Yes
Lets do four since I forgot
Four claps for Ross
Thank you friends
Lets challenge our brain just a little bit
More challenging
Lets say it
Ready
Go
Go
Zero and seventy one hundreds
Okay go
All right Im over here at Miss Kays desk
Youll show me your whiteboard this way please
Three two one and show
Excellent
Ella may I borrow your board
Ella would you share with us what you have
Here it comes tadah
Go ahead and tell us your thinking
I did seven
How would you say this seven
Seven tens plus one hundreds
Hand signals please
Hand signals please
Sophia do you have a hand signal for me
Thank you my dear
All right yeehaw for Ella
Ready
Go
Go
Yeehaw
Thanks for sharing
Well do one more
Hey before we write lets read it
Eyes on the screen
Ready
Go
Go
Nine hundred six and forty five thousands
Excellent job
Please write that in expanded form
So you want to think about how much is each digit worth
Please show me your whiteboard
Three two one and show
Awesome job thank you
Emily may I borrow yours please
Would you please share your thinking
Get your hand signals ready fifth graders
I did 900 plus six plus fourtens plus fivethousands because that equals 906 45 thousands
Let me see your hand signals fifth graders
She missed something in what she said
Oh
Yes the end
Well lets think about how we could say it in a way that helps us add to our thinking
Emily do you want to call in someone to help you
Brendan
My thinking is different by this something that you accidentally said four tens when it was four hundreds
Sometimes that happens when you share out loud in front of people
That happens to me all the time
So it would be 900 plus six plus four
How would we say this part
Four hundreds and five thousands
That makes sense hun
Yes
Two claps ready
Thank you
All right friends please raise your boards
When we get to were going to move on to our actual lesson for today
Today were going to be looking at fraction of problems
Were connecting to some parts of fractions that we already know
Lets read our learning intentions for today
Our learning target
It starts with I can and I want to hear all of your voices
Ready
Go
Go
I can solve fraction of problems and connect these problems to multiplication on fractions by whole numbers
As we move through our lesson today by the end of our lesson you will know youre successful by solving problem four
It is a fraction of problem
You will solve it by yourself so that Miss Kay and I can see your thinking
We have a key vocabulary today thats going to help us
On your whiteboard right now please write the words unit fraction
Unit fraction might be something youve heard of before
It might not be something youve heard of before
We have a definition up here but I want us to come up with A fifthgrade definition or definition in our own words
Id like you to read up there what is a unit fraction
You see some pictures or some models of a unit fraction
Then Id like you to write down in your own words what do you think a unit fractions is
Take a minute or so to write down what is a unit fraction in your own words
There is a definition up there theres also some pictures some models to show you what a unit function is but we need a fifthgrade definition
We need a definition that fifth graders will understand because well be using this vocabulary in our math lesson today
We need to know in our own words what is a unit fraction
The picture is really what helps me understand that the picture model
All right ladies and gentlemen were going to practice using some of our mouth talk sentences
Youre going to partner up with someone sitting close to you do you have perfect partners Miss Kay
Yes
Who do you partner with
Would you please show me now by turning your bodies so that I can see who youre talking to
I love Jayden could you turn and join the lady sitting behind you please and Id like for the person with that lighter colored hair to be the first person to talk
I want you to try to use some of this vocabulary like my thinking is similar except I wrote or Id like to add on to what you wrote
Lighter hair youre talking first
Im going to give you one minute with you and your partners to try to come to a similar understanding of what is a unit fraction go
You two
Yes but they all have different denominators
Both of your ideas together and then come up with one definition that you both agree on
Commercial break
Remember thats one of  things commercial break just means quick pause
In our commercial right now what Id like you to do is take words from one persons definition words from another combine them so that you both agree on one good solid definition
What do we think a unit faction is
Be ready to share
Back to your talking and thinking
Go
Go
Theyre the same thing
The numerator is always one such as the denominator
We both agree already but yours sounds better
You have a longer definition
Its a fraction model where the numerator is the same and then denominator is different
The numerator is the same of a one fraction the denominator is different
Because the numerator is always one does that mean none of these fractions could ever be equivalent
A fraction where the  is one and the denominator is different
What word can you change here instead of just doing different what word can we use here
The denominator is the
Is the number of
Samples
Yes
Tell me more about the
The whole fraction
The number of
The number
Of pieces in the whole
Yes
Thank you
Would you please turn your eyes and ears back to the screen
No please dont erase yet thank you for asking
Mia may I have you come up and stand up front and share is it okay if I have you we put your bottom definition up
A unit fraction is one for the numerator and the denominator is the number that shows how many pieces are in a whole
Basically in a unit fraction the numerator should be a one and the denominator is going to be the amount of pieces drawn or shown in the denominator
I heard you say usually in a unit fraction one is usually the numerator
What do we think about that
In a unit fraction one is usually the numerator
Hand signals please
Hand signals please
calling someone
Its okay but I just want to make it clear to our class that a unit fraction always has one as the what
Numerator
And whats the denominator in the unit fraction
Any number
But it shows the
Pieces that are in the whole
The pieces that are in the whole
Now you may erase your board and now you may head back to your seats
Please keep your whiteboard and marker on top of your desk
Wait I showed you how many of these fifth graders I told you this is why I like coming into fifth grade classroom because you show youre ready
Id like to look at Brendans desk right now
Jaydens desk I still look like youd have a whiteboard and a marker
Were going to do a couple of practice problems before we jump right into our master law
All right would you please show me on your board one fifth of 15
Id like you to write that
One fifth of 15
My friends think about we just went over the definition of unit fraction
Do you see a unit fraction
Say the unit fraction
One fifteenth
Lets try that again
The unit fraction is always when we have a one as the numerator and the denominator is the number of pieces correct
Yes
What is the unit fraction in this problem
Ready
Go
Go
One fifth
One fifth is the unit fraction
One fifth of 15
What is this asking
I dont want to know the answer
I want to know what is this asking
High five your shoulder partner
That means you have to look at your shoulder partner
You might even have to say good morning to your shoulder partner
What is this problem asking
Talk to you shoulder partner
What is it asking
What is it asking
Basically 15 divided by five
say 15 divided by five
How did you know that
How did you know that Jayden
Could you draw it
Please bring your conversations to a close
Id like to just ask is there someone willing to share what is this problem asking us to do
Emma
Im going have you turn around and face your classmates and then I want classmates to remember when someones speaking what should we do doing
Listening
Listening because our job in math is to listen for understanding
Emma sharing right now is to see if you understand the same way she does okay
Go
Go
The fraction  asking what is one fifth of 15
What is that asking us to do
Asking us to figure out what is one fifth of 15 and what number it is
Excellent
Would you call you on someone else please to continue our conversation
Sofia
Me and Julia talked about one fifth of 15 is telling us how many one fifth goes into 15 how many times
I might  more except that I think that it may be how much of a fifth would go into 15
I think were on the right track
It might help if we show it
On your whiteboard right now solve this problem but I also want you to show me how do you know youre right with a picture or an equation or another way that shows youre thinking it on the board okay
Go
Go
Sophia I want to see this on your board too because when I can see what kids are thinking on their board it helps me with my teaching
Its for me
It helps me know what I need to teach next okay
I want you to bring the answer and show me how you know
You might show with a number model you might show with a picture you might show with a different way
how would you show one fifth or how would you break them into five groups
Thats what I would do first is just draw out five dots I mean sorry 15
How would you prove this is right
and five times three equals 15
It is right but how do you know its right
Would you be willing to share that on the board
Would you be willing to share that on the board
Okay hang on
I like this
Tell me more about this
I drew this because of one fifth and I did  and then Im going to shade it and then Im just going to
Each one of these is  one fifth
Will you be willing to share that on the board
Would you be willing to share that  on the board
Would you be willing to share that on the board
Would you be willing to share that on the board
Jayden you go up and draw yours
Liam go up and find a different place on the board to show your thinking
I want you to go up and draw on another place on the board your thinking
My friends at desks would you please give me a high five
Avery would you find a place up there
High five
At your table groups right now would you please do a round robin
Thats where each person shares their thinking and then stand up when your whole team has shared their thinking
That means youre looking at your team mates right now
If you have a team mate thats missing dont worry theyll be back in a minute
Team mate one youre starting
Share your thinking
If team mate one is gone you go to team mate number two share your thinking
Stand up when your whole team has share
Go
Go
Put one here
My friends up here Ill take your markers when youre done please thank you
Thank you
I should be seeing teams standing up
If your whole team is done sharing please stand up
Ladies and gentlemen if everyone can please stand and Id like you to please come back to the carpet with your white board
Sit in your assigned spot
Avery do you have a marker
Did you already give it back to me
I do think I might be missing one marker
Jayden
Thank you my dear
Jayden would you stay standing for me
Im so excited fifth graders to show you all this different thinking because I will tell you there are so many ways to think about fraction of problems
What way I think about it might be different than how some of you think about it
Jayden would you start as our first teacher to share how did you think about what is one fifth of 15
First I drew  which is 15
Each row here is one fifth  is also three and the whole represents 15
Fifth graders I would like for you to use our math language chart and talk to Jayden about how he thought
Jayden call on someone
You have something Brendan
He explained it very well
Was your thinking similar
It was my thinking was similar
Except I didnt draw on the right but I did the same because I knew that five fifths
I know if you multiply five by three you get 15
So that will be 15 fifths
Then if you break that into a mixed number it will just be three wholes
Please give Jayden a golf clap
Excellent
Who else
Ryan your turn next
Go on down
Because my friends I walked around and I said wow look at how Ryan solved
Hey Ryan tell us about your thinking
So I knew one fifth of 15 and I drew a circle and I split it into fifths
Why
I did that because you said one fifth of 15
So I made this
Then I knew five times three equal 15
So I did three on each my fifths
When you said you did you wrote three on each fifth because
Because of one fifth of 15 and theres five threes in 15
So I wrote threes to represent my answer
So when you say there are five threes in 15 If we think back to our learning intention which was connecting multiplication to fraction of problems
Everybody think for a minute
Did Ryan connect multiplication to fraction of problems
How
Call on someone
Because he knew that three times five is 15
Okay
Everybody say thank you Ryan
Thank you Ryan
All right whos next
Avery would you mind going up next
So fifth graders I want you to be thinking about look at how there were several different ways to solve one fifth of 15
There was five one fifth and  five times three equals 15
Questions comments feedback for Avery
Like for her to be able to hear from someone that she hasnt heard from yet
Someone that hasnt shared yet
Ryan weve heard from you
No what do you think about how Avery solved Elijah
She put three into fives
So she knew she had 15 as her total and she divided them into five groups of threes
The connection to multiplication is
Five times three equals 15
Awesome
Everybody say were proud of you Avery
Were proud of you Avery
Whos next
I forgot who else I called
Liam
Liam sorry my friend
I liked Liams because it was simple and down to the point
But you know what Ill tell you something when I said Liam how did you get your answer
I said its right but how did you get it
Five times three equals 15 and automatically that one fifth of 15 is three
So knowing the connection between multiplication what would you say the connection is between multiplication and unit fraction of problems
So lets say like this part is
You can use that green marker you can use any expo marker
So you can tell that this is one you multiply like that
Then so this  you divide up here
You have to know what the easy problems are first
If you cant think of something easy then you can go to something
Say congratulations Liam first
Congratulations Liam
Now my friends  leaving these up today
Theyre going to help you heres why
If we know that one talk with me ready I want to hear all of your voices
One fifth of 15 is three
Right
Okay going big now
What is two fifths of 15
And what is let me do this one down here four fifths of 15
Okay so you are going to go back to your seats and solve two fifths of 15
You shouldnt need to
Two fifths of 15
Perhaps three fifths of 15  on your whiteboards go
I cant hear you
Great so as Im walking around Id like to see two fifths of 15 equals
Four fifths of 15 equals
So if you know one fifth of 15 equals three  whats two fifths three fifths four fifths of 15
All right
Think about the groups
All right please share your thinking with your shoulder partner for two fifths three fifths four fifths go
How did you know
What is two fifths of 15
How did you know
Would you be willing to share this
Would you be willing to share how you got this
Would you be willing to share how you got
Okay
Ladies and gentlemen would you please bring your conversations to a close
All right
Ive asked a couple of students
If I have asked you to come down would you please come down to share your thinking
Caleb
Who else
Okay
Did I give you a marker
Okay
So this is how you would show that youre showing active listening right now
Would you put the lid on your marker and face the screen
Your classmates are showing you their thinking
Okay
Im going to have you turn your bodies so that you are
Show active listening
Show active listening
Caleb can you tell us your thinking first
My thinking was lets I had  and I wanted 25 of it and then I would get six apples
How did you get six
I got six because
Can you use the picture model thats on the screen that Avery wrote
We know 15 of 15 is three
Could that picture help you
Okay
Tell us how you got six
Can I just draw an arrow
As soon as I draw an arrow I think it might be a clue
So if we have 15 of 15 is there thats here
Right
This is one group
One group 15 of 15 equals
Three
The second group of dots gets us what
Six
Six
Does that help
You got it
Lets do 35
we have three
15 of 15 is
What class
Three
Three
What is 25 of 15
Six
Write it
I just heard someone go Oh yeah
Caleb thank you for showing us that
My friends tell Caleb Awesome job
Awesome job Caleb
Okay
Now Caleb showed us 25 and 35 and now we have 45
first question we get was  the original answer was 3 x 4 because all were doing was find 45 of 15 and I got
Class what do we think
Yes
Yes
I agree
Would you please write that over Caleb can you write 12 under There you go
That one so that we can see
There we go
My friends our last question is what is 55 of 15
Whole class what is it
Fifteen
Fifteen
Whats the rule
What is the rule or pattern
What is the rule or pattern
That is our big thinking
If you can get this What is the rule or pattern it is going to help you with not only todays math lesson but so many more
So would you please give these two classmates a big round of applause fort their bravery
Ill take your markers
Thank you my friends
Thank you my friends
All right
This is talk time
What is the rule
I have that written right here
What is the rule
What is the pattern
What is the rule or pattern
What is the rule or pattern
Talk at your teams
Ready
Go
Go
Multiplied by one more
Very tardy
You want to make dumplings
Egg roll
All right
Ladies and gentlemen please close your conversations
Im telling you this rule right now getting our thinking out right now for this rule this is going to help you with all the rest of our problems today
I heard it over here actually
Liam will you help us start
Liam and Jayden
Whats our rule
To multiply by whatever number you need to
So the rule would be Start with this word
First what do we need to do
Say that Jayden real loud so everyone can hear you
Find 15 of 15
First find the
We call that what
Say it class
Unit fraction
So in this case we have to find what is 15 of 15
Okay
Then Liam after that whats the rule that will always work
By
Multiplied by the
Number
Its not any number
I couldnt do 58
You could
We have to do
What part of the fraction
The numerator
The
The numerator
Numerator
Numerator
Then multiply by the numerator
Lets try it
Okay
Boards away journals out
Were almost there my friends
Were just going to do a couple of problems for math today
I know but thats just howTteaches and Miss Kay knows that
We will all be fine
I totally promise
Can I see your
Avery what page are you on
Please turn to 167
Okay
My friends guess what
You just did the math message
We already did half the page
You just did it on your whiteboard
So to make sure that we all have the thinking lets fill out the math message now
Okay
Okay
You know this
What is 15 of 15
I know
Thats right
Right here 15 of 10
You got it
What is 15 of 25
Good
See
Youve got this
Youve got this
Yes
Yes
It just looks different
It just looks different
See
Youve got this my friends
Right
Hey because once you know the unit fraction you can multiply to figure out the others
I already did that one
I already did that one
How many  12
Its two
Its two
I know that one
Whos the agent now
Im just going to write seven
I dont know
Plus 12  2 is 24
Commercial break
My friends can you please give me a quick high five
High fives mean Im going to turn my head Im going to make sure I can see Ms Travers
Heres what Id like you to do
Id like you to do number three in your journal
Im going to give you just about 30 seconds and then were going to talk about number three on the screen
Number four is the one Miss Kay and I are checking to check your understanding
Okay
Do number three right now and then well talk together
Go
Go
Youre going to have to first figure out what is 13
Yes
So whats 13 of nine
Okay
So with 34 of 18
13 is three so 23 is
What is 13 of 24
Eight
Eight
Yes
Numbers here are really really hard
So 23 of 24 is
Number two is really hard
Now youre to figure out whats 13 of
Number two is really hard
What do you want
Nothing
Whats your next step
You got it
I want you to read this question
Okay friends
Please come back together
Brendan will you share with us your thinking here on number three
On number three
How did you start
I started with looking at the first two which showed kind of Actually I first looked at what the rule was
Okay
The rule is 23 thats not a unit fraction so what was your step
My step first was to find the unit fraction of each of the numbers and then multiply that by two
I would have to think to myself this is asking 23 but before I can figure out 23 remember our rule
Miss Kay is standing by the rule
First find the unit fraction So 23 of nine I need to find 13 of nine first
So whats onethird of nine Brendan
Three
One third of nine is three and then we multiply
By two
by two and get
Six
Six
So how did that help you here on the 12
I did and then you put the same thing find out 13 of 12 is 4 so then 4  2 is 8
I love Averys hand signal
Yes my dear
On the second one for six I know that 3  2 Wait
No
Oh yes 3 2 is 6 so then I would have to do 2  2 and I know thats 4
My friends my job for you right now is just number four
Just number four is your math job today
Miss Kay and I are coming around
Were just going to be doing some checking on how youre doing on number four
If you finish four you may do five and six
We have about two minutes
Is that okay
Yes
Yes
Okay friends is the same thing as multiplying
I see you sometimes getting confused just because their symbol is different
That last problem where there is a multiplication signal thats the same thing as if theres  its the same thing
If you look right where my fingers are thats what Miss Kay is talking about of and times are the same thing in fractions
There was a little confusion there
Perfect
Thats why coteaching is so powerful
I know
Got it
You may move on
Okay
So my friends if you have finished numbers three and four please move on to five and six but Miss Kay and I are coming around to check number four
Im done
Then you may move on to five and six
That would be seven and six
Four times six
Yes
Four times
So the first thing did you figure out what those are
Those are
No
You dont remember
Because if I did it and youre looking over here its never
I want you notice up here find the unit fraction first
So for here I would say what is 14 of eight
Because after I tell you 14 of eight then I can multiply that times three to get this
Go ahead and continue with five and six
And you get
and you got
24
Keep going
Always find this first what is 14 of 12
Does that help
Okay
Show me where you are
How did you get 21 right there
Hmm
Is it wrong too
Its wrong
Good
Im asking you to share your thoughts
I got seven and I just multiplied it by three
You got it
Perfect
How did you 15 right here
Because originally four times five is 20 multiplying five times  all that
Yes
Yes
Keep going
Show me Brendan
Were you able to finish  here
Not quite yet
Thats what you can do now
How are you doing Caleb
A tip
To remember
Oh I love how you started 14 of eight
Its like youre getting that
He was yelling
What is 14
Youve got it
Five times three equals 15
Youve got it
I knew it
I knew
Sophia show me what you have
Feeling good
Feeling good
Is it chicken or is it
So youre writing a  now
Number model what turns what
Not 20 I was telling him that
Do like what we were doing on the screen
I dont know
What is it asking
What is it asking
What  times this
If I win  teacher  said that
I would be a snitch
Im not going tell you now
Shes just telling us
Well Im not going help you with that one
Think through this
Check that one again
Okay
Thank you
Well what do you want
I dont like the
I knew seven times four equals to 28 so I did this 24
Keep going
Yes
Yes
Keep going
Keep going
Im going to help you think about this Liam
This isnt wrong but you did multiply four times two
Its asking you to think about what  of fraction in your number  Number story with a fraction
Good job
what hes saying that you dont need the board
Good job
I like how youre going back and revising your thinking
Have you finished math boxes
Yes
No
It doesnt give you the answer really
Okay
Fifth graders please give me a high five
I just want to say thank you for your time
Thank you for practicing all this math language and math talk
I enjoyed coming in
How would you know your successful today is if you solved number four and youre able to say I know the rule for fraction of problems
Okay
So give yourselves a nice pat on the back
You may put your math away and Miss Kay will give you your next direction
Bye
See you
Ms Travers would you like me to stopI said Bye
See you on my microphone
Bye
