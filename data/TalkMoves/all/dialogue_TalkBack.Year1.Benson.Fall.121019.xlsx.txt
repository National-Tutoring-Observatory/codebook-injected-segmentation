Okay so can you guys see
Yes
Yes your learning intention is you can multiply twodigit numbers by twodigit numbers
Were building up our skills two digits by two digits and were going to use partial product strategy
Well practice using the partitioned rectangles but then apply that practice doing partial products
Youll be successful if you can solve twodigit by twodigit numbers and you can match your partitioned rectangles to your partial products
Making sure that you can see how your answers should be the same
Okay
Youre mental math youre just doing quick extended facts
No youre not going to work and your math message is at the top of page 130 just problem one
Theres a partitioned rectangle problem followed by a partial products problem
Please go check your homework with a partner
Get started on mental math
Do problem one on page 130 and well get started in about eight minutes
Go
Why are you just automatically changing your answer
How do you know he is right
Talk about what steps you took to get there
Im sorry
If you werent
You guys should go ask someone else
Youre comparing
Yes
Start again
I have no idea what you just said
You said what
Yes but youre  Its just picking out different areas
You have about another minute and a half
Okay
30 more seconds
Both of those different problems
Show me on your fingers if you need more time
How many minutes do you need
Five is not going to happen
Two and three so Ill give about two and a half more
Hustle up
Okay
Times up
Lets see what you got two
All right who did pink problems
Okay so
4 times 50
30 times 7
70 times 8
I hear you thinking
Basic facts with what
Yes
I heard it
I heard you say 56 and  thinking through
20 times 40
Why Clayton
Why not 80
Because 80 wouldnt work because theres 2 zeros added
Okay
Basic fact in there
Two extra zeros added in there
70 times 40
9 times 30
60 times 800
804 80000 48000
Why 48000 and not 4800
Matt why not
Because there is 4 zeros
4 extra zeros to your basic fact
600 times 40
I heard that 24000
900 times 9
Oh I hear 8100
I hear 81 000 Whos correct
Why
Why is it not 81000
Because there is only 2 zeros
Two zeros
So if I write product for my basic fact David how many zeros should I add to the end of that
Do you revise your thinking
Yes
It was following a pattern and then it messed you up didnt it
Yes
All right
You may erase yes
Erase your whiteboard
Hi
On your math journal on the top two problems Thank you
Whats different from the problem that were looking at compared to what weve been doing
Jesse whats different about this problem
Its multiplication
Weve been working on multiplication all unit long so whats different about this
Were doing a twodigit number times a twodigit number
Were doing a twodigit number times a twodigit number
What have we been doing
A twodigit times a onedigit right
So its a little bit different
Let me make sure I have the right I dont think I have the right page
Thats not the right one
Yes thats not the right one
I was going to say This is not the right page
Thats so interesting that it has
Its page 130
Thank you
Theyre having to look back at that page and I think I copied the wrong one onto the screen
Sorry about that
Lets get the right page up
Yes
Its thinking
Think think think
Its really thinking and thinking and thinking
Well have to use the book
Okay
All right
Here is the correct page so when I ask us whats different about this problem it makes more sense now
Were doing twodigit numbers times twodigit numbers whereas before we were doing twodigit numbers times a onedigit number
All right someone who has theirs drawn and feels pretty confident about their work the way they worked that problem with a partition rectangle raise your hand if you feel pretty confident and you wanted to come share
Carson you want to bring your book up here
You lay your book right on top of mine and we should be able to see it really well
Can you talk us through what you did
I Jesse the  three up there and then multiply 3 times 2 equals 6
Then add 2 zeros and multiply 4 times 2 equals 12 8
Oh look at that revision right there good job lady
It helps to talk yourself through it doesnt it
So your answer will change a little bit wont it
Im glad you saw that and we didnt have to correct you
4 times 2 equals 8
600 so I need to multiply 600 plus 80 equals 680
Any disagreements with how Carson set up her partition rectangle
Jesse
Well Im not in disagreement but
She just talked you through
What did you do differently
Well I think she got 600 for 20 times 30 but I didnt get that
Did you forget to add 2 zeros
Yes
Do you see where your revision would happen
Okay
Anyone else have a different response
Anyone do it differently as far as the partition rectangle goes
Everyone on the count of three were going to give Carson a big excellent
One two three
Excellent
Thank you
My book is still up there so you wont see the partition rectangle anymore
Who got all the way to doing it partial product way
Anyone feel pretty confident about how they did it and would be willing to share
These hands went Matt feeling confident
Put your book right on top of mine and well be able to see what youre doing
I did 2 times 3 and added the zeros so I got 600
I got 600 because of the 2 zeros
Then I did 2 times 4 and then I added a zero and got 80
Then put plus 80
606
88
0
Anyone do it differently
Dakota do you have a different answer or did you just do the process differently
I did the process differently
Okay thank you
Lets give Matt a yeehaw
Yeehaw
Thank you Matt for being brave
All right Dakota go show us what you did differently
It takes a lot of courage to go up there
I wrote down 30 plus 20times 20
Times 20 thank you
then I put 30 times 20 equals 600
Then I added 4 times 20 equals 80 and then I got 680
So you did it right underneath the way that they kind of modeled for us
Yes
Everyone understand and agree
Any disagreements on how Matt or Dakota solved their problem
No
Lets give her a shhshhshhshhshh your great
Shhshhshhshhshh your great
Thank you for sharing
All right my friends
Were going to do a couple of practice questions
Take out your whiteboard
Please show me a partition rectangle for the problem 30 times 87 on your whiteboard
A partition rectangle of 30 and 87
All right what I want you to do is look at your face partner
Carson come
You guys be just a group of three
Actually Dallas will you go be Carsons face partner a little bit
face partner on the table and one of yours is Lisa
You be partners with Megan
Please go quick or Carson you can go there
It might be easier if you can go up there
I want you to take your whiteboard and swap with your face partner
I want you to analyze all these little problems
If you disagree I want you to talk about what you didnt do or if you have questions about what they did
Can you listen to directions first so you know what you need to do
Thank you
Analyze what your partner did
See if you can follow the steps that they took
Make sure you agree with them
If you disagree or youre confused on what steps they took I want you to ask them about it
Why did you write 240
Why did you write 180
Why did you add these numbers together
I dont understand how you can put your rectangle
Those are the kinds of questions I want you to be asking each other
If you totally agree I want you to describe what your partner did
I see that you split your rectangle into blah blah blah because Talk through your problems
Make sure you give your partner  that
Thank you for  to explain
I would like Jesse and Faith to come and explain how they did their problem
I need you to come up and you can just show on your whiteboard if you want
You can write on my whiteboard if you want
Is that marker not working
Three times seven that equals 21
Then I added a zero because theres a zero to three and I added three times eight equals 24
Then I added two zeros
Did you really
Yes
All right where
How
Keep that
What did you notice that Faith did while she was reworking her problem
Because this is really what she had on her original whiteboard and Richard had on his original whiteboard
What did she do as she was working through the second time Jocelyn
When she did 30 times 80 she forgot to add another zero
But as she was working it did she actually do it right the first time
Yes
She did
Thats why I said Really you did
because when you first worked it you just added one zero but when you worked it the second time you actually did it right
How many extra zeros are in the  problem
Two
When you started working it the second time you realized that actually should have two zeros because eight times three is 24 but with an extra 10 here and another extra 10 here theres only going to be two zeros
Every single person except for You missed that the first time right Pat
Most of you are being really careful to make sure you add the zeros on
It makes a huge difference
2400 is not very close to 240 is it
No
Makes a huge difference on the total amount of your product when you finally add everything together
That was really cool to watch you
You had it and then I asked you and you were like Oh wait wait
No
Joel thank you
Me and David did the same thing just
Then when I walked by it was like
Can we show what we did
Yes you can use your whiteboard
Thank you guys lets give them a roller coaster
there you go
So David
Before Joel corrected me I wrote 240 right here because I thought 30 times 80 was 240 and then Joel told me that I had to add two extra zeros and the I got 2610
2610 is very different than 500something isnt
Before we did that David
When we put the extra zero to 240 he thought it was going be 405  but then he realized that it needed this
Can I draw the columns for you
See thats the problem when you dont have your numbers in columns there you go
So we did zero zero zero
up for me a little bit there you go
426  we got 2610
Give it a high thumbs up if you got 2610
If you didnt get that if your high thumbs up isnt out do you realize what you needed to make it correct and accurate
Thank you guys for sharing lets give them
Thank you so much
All right lets look at your math journal page 130
Lets look at problem number two
With 34 on the bottom and 17 the side
This changes things a little bit because if we look at what we had before we had 20 and 34 it was easy to split our 34 into 30 plus 4
Whats different about our second number that were multiplying together
Clayton
Its twodigit numbers with no zeros
Yes its not just the multiple of 10 is it
17 isnt a multiple of 10 is it
No
Not a 10 20 30 40 easy number to multiply together so you might need to put that and create four boxes
Im actually going to move my 17 to the other side to make it a little bit easier
The 3 in 34 is worth what
30 the 4 in 34 is worth what
Zach what is the 1 in 17 worth
on the top row
Jasper what is the 7 is 17 worth
Seven
Seven
I just have more multiplication problems to do now
Im going to kind of like what you guys were doing remember that weird table we had to use when we were doing weird math where you had to bring the two together
Right here in this box Im going to zoom this in as much as I can without making it too blurry
In this box right here what multiplication fact am I going to do
30 times 10
What is 30 times 10
Not plus
Chandler
It is 130 oh no
30 times 10
300 sir youre correct
In the box right below it what multiplication problem am I going to solve
Joel
30 times 7
What is 30 times 7
David
I have more multiplication problems to solve
What is 4 times 10
Joel
4 times 10 is 40
40 and then whats the multiplication problem for this last box
Josh
7 times 4
7 times 4 which is
Just 28 because there are no extra zeros just 28
Now Im going to add up all these products small products that I got in the middle of my boxes Im going to add all those together
I have to do 3002104028
Is this going to be really important for you to line up your places properly
Yes
Yes make sure all your ones are lined up all your tens are lined up all your 100 are lined up
Im going to let you solve that real quick
Thumbs up when you have the
Brant what did you get
578 anyone get something different
Joel what did you get
I thought 378
Oh I see that
You see what you got
Everyone else got 578
Yes
Go to the next box over
Were going to write this problem as 34 times 17
I want you to get used to going Oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes
The reason why Im having you go here and here is because you have to multiply all the values times each other and it looks like this
Ill show you what I mean
What is the value of these three right here
I need to multiply that times the value of this digit right here which is
10 Im done here
Now Im going to take this value of this digit which was what
30 and I have to multiply it here whats the value of this digit
Seven
Seven Im done with Uh uh I need to take the value of this digit what was that
One
Its worth 10
I need to multiply here
Whats this digit worth
Four
Four
I need to do this last one
The value of this times this is
4 times 7
I can multiplytwodigitstimestwodigits
Okay
Once you get all your facts sorted out then you could find the answers to them and you add them all together
What is 3 times 1
Three
3 times 1 is 3 and I have two extra zeros on the end of that 73
What is 3 times 7
Along with an extra zero
10 times 4
7 times 4
Add them all together making sure all of your columns are appropriately lined up
I have a feeling youre going to get a very common answer with your
again
Do these two things match
Yes
You did was effective
Okay
Youre going to practice trying the partial product
It does not matter what order you do them in as long as all values get multiplied times each other
Never going straight across
We dont break 80 and 7 into Looks like this
Beside each other because thats part of your number
Just think about  Okay
Try it
If you get stuck imagine what youre doing thousands of numbers and we come look over here to  how they did it
Have at it
This is on your own
Okay
Yes you may have your snacks
I chew one or just
