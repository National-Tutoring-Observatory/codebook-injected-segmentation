With these  is that what it should look like
Thats not your answer
They model up
Did you get the xintercept
It says solve
In other words the values of the variables could make that
I was just comparing it to his because he got a perfect square
Sorry that got just really anxious
You do not enter the standard form you wont see a square root but you could have a factor that has a square root
For this what should I do here
X
You got to think of all four factors together
When you look at  Does it look like that
The only strategies we have listed right here
These four and that one
It got to be one of those five strategies
If it doesnt then you got to use this
So theres three terms
Its either this or that
You didnt write W2
Look at the square
Considering how Mrs Saunders may have constructed the test I am taking a very wild estimated guess that its 1
For the first one
The last one is going to be the hardest one because its going to have decimals
It is good its time to learn now
Pull out the example
Theres only three examples in 35 so all the problems are those examples
Yes
When you have three terms of these theres only one that has got three terms
After we are done with the quiz Ill show you how to do what you are asking about
Its not quite straightforward
All right ladies and gentlemen
All right so the 35 homework thats what youre doing right now basically is like the 35 homework
This is all 35 content
Now of course 35 you cant do without factoring
Its kind of a combination of 34 and 35
Obviously how long have we spent on this now so far
Think about whats next
Whens our test
Wednesday
Wednesday a shorter period
You have to be able to do these kinds of things in about a halfhour
In other words youve got to get to the point where you could take this packet and do it in about a halfhour or so
Why is it on Wednesday and not Tuesday
Maybe
Thats just the way the schedule worked out
No we got Wednesday
Thats why Im trying to get you to see
Youve got to know how to do this right away
Now what Id like to do we only have about five minutes left so put all of the quizzes together make sure youre turning them in as a team
Then Ill probably give you time tomorrow
Go ahead and turn them in and then you can leave the books on the desks
All right Ill turn mine in
If theres a specific type of problem you want to talk about before you leave thats why Im giving us a few minutes if you want any particular questions about any of the examples
If you would go ahead and turn off the microphones for me and just leave them where they are
Like t minus four the first parenthesis
Then multiply
By t minus
Is that the answer
Oh no because then you have to figure out what the xs are so this was part That one is the positive four that one is positive four
How do we know they are positive
Because if you say x minus six or t minus six is zero what makes that into zero like what number do you have to put into t to make it zero
Remember how z equals that squared
Replace the z with an x squared and then you need to get the factor for more
George what did you get for five
I literally hate this class so much Im going to cry
I know I am Im crying
I cant do it
Ladies and gentlemen none of the team have finished
Youre all in the same boat which also means that between now and Wednesday weve got to get infinitely faster at identifying strategies and being able to work it
Go ahead and put all of your teams work together so you turn it in together and then put it in the basket
