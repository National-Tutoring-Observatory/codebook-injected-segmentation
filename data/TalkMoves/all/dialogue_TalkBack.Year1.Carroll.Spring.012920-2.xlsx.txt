Okay
Okay
Today learning targets is to be able to review our fraction test and learn from the fraction test some things that we need to get better at
So on this math paper were going to keep this math paper over several the page that you had the blank piece of paper
Put your name on that because were going to keep this over several keep that off the desk
I dont like stickers on the desk
Were going to keep this over several Wednesdays that were doing this
All right
So today were just going to do one and two
Put one and two on your math paper and heres number one
One of two
Were going to do two problems
Number one
My one is huge
You dont have to write the problem
I just want the answers
One and two
Okay
Okay
Number one you do not have to write the problem
Youre writing the answer
I dont know whats happening at team five
We had a rough time during silent reading
We need to pull it together and get ready to pay attention right now
Okay
Okay
The problem is there are 15 bags of MMs that will go in 27 tubs of trail mix
How many bags will go in each trail mix
There are 27
Theres 27
Theres 15 bags of MMs
I know
and 27 tubs
Remember this is our fraction unit so that should give you a clue that your answer is going to be in a fraction
We went over this one last week how to do this kind of problem last week
Okay
Okay
Are we ready for number two
No
We should just be writing the fraction
Fifteen MMs and 27 tubs of trail mix
Okay
Okay
Number two
Write a number story for 3   7  37
Write a number story for 3   7  37
What did she say
Write a number story with the problem 3   7  37
Write a number story for 3   7  37
Write a number story for 3   7  37
When I pass your paper leave it flipped upside down until I come and turn it over
Write a The first one
Yes
Theres 15 bags of MMs and 27 tubs of trail mix
I said leave it flipped over until I tell you and turn that back over
Leave it flipped over
Its 3   7  37
No
No
Leave it just like this
Write a number story for 3   7  37
Write a number story for 3   7  37
Okay
Okay
Hunter will you go pick up these papers
Make sure your names on them
Wheres the
Its over there
in the corner anyway
I know
I think you round
Okay
Okay
If your white paper is  you may turn your tests over
Wait
Did you grade the
Okay
If your white paper
Are we doing the next page
All right
Eagle high five
Okay
Okay
Were going to look on our math test at three and four
We looked at one and two
We are now looking at number three and four today
We may get onto the next page
I did grade the second page if you want to look at that
I have not graded the last page yet
We went over one and two last time and then I had you practice to see if you remember how to do problems like one and two today
Okay
Okay
I cant hear what youre saying
Are we doing number three
I did B wrong too
I got B wrong too
I got three wrong because I subtracted instead of
I added
I multiplied it
I subtracted but I didnt get the right answer
Robert you failed
I added it
She had to use red
Of all the color she had to  I hate red
Okay
Okay
Eagle high five
Do I have everyones white papers
Five and three two one
Ive asked for eagle high five three times now
All right
Were going to look at number three
Autumn is making and I want you to take notes on your paper
Okay
Okay
This is your note catcher
If you didnt take this test on assessment day I gave you a blank one so your job is to be taking notes
This is not for a grade
This is to help us make sure that we understand these
But it wasnt just a pretest
We did a pretest at the beginning of the year
We did a midtest
We still havent learned all the concepts here on the fractions
So this is a midtest
So its a midtest to see
This is really tricky in the middle of four
Okay
Okay
Then we will take one at the end and that one will be for a grade
Robert
So we took this before
will you raise your hand
We took this before winter break
We took it on assessment day when we came back
Remember when Ms Holly was in here
Yes
This was one of your assessments that you did
But on Wednesday since its our review day then were spending some time doing this
All right
Number three Autumn is making two different salads
One calls for three and threefourths cups chopped spinach
The other calls for two and twothirds cups chopped spinach
How much spinach does Autumn need
We need a number model and we need a answer
Talk with your shoulder partner about which operation are you going to do
Are you going to do subtraction addition division or multiplication and what words are possibly giving you the hint
Addition
You have to do addition
Because it says how
how much  subtraction
Im going to put a plus sign above the points there on addition
I think we all did addition
That will be nice
Because it says like in all how much addition
Okay
Okay
Team one
Which one
Are we doing addition subtraction multiplication or division
Do subtraction
Okay
Okay
Subtraction
What do you think
Addition
Addition
Addition
Whats this team thinking
Addition
Addition
Addition
Addition
Addition
Addition
Addition
Addition
Raise your hand
What clue words made you feel like it was addition
Frankie
How much spinach does she need
Okay
Okay
How much
How much lets see if thats in here
It isnt on our clue words but when youre trying to figure out how many
Many is up there
Now all together No
Its not up there
Robert
I like subtraction
How many more is on subtraction
So if I know that how many its subtraction then I know how much is probably addition
Okay
Okay
If we were to write a number sentence Sophie what if were trying to figure out how much what would we be adding
Three and threefourths
Three and threefourths and two and twothirds equals F Thats our number sentence
Delilah did that
If you dont have that on yours underneath it write it
I have that
I do
Now if we wanted to add these talk to your team on a strategy to figure out how to add these two together
Talk with your team
Figure out how youre going to add these two together
First you do
Actually the big the whole  equal five
Are we doing it
You dont  but you dont the denominator
Whats your strategy
because thats why got it wrong because you dont
Ive got five and fivetenths because I dont know I tried to use the circles and I counted them
So I had fivetenths of it
Whats your strategy
What s your strategy here
What is your strategy
So our strategy was that we did first two  and then we would add these
Not the denominator
That s why she got it wrong
Okay
Okay
Eagle high five
One thing I heard is converting the fractions
We havent really done that
You may have done it last year
You may know how to do that
We havent done that but I did hear some people say add the whole numbers first and they got five
Okay
Okay
Then add the fractions with possibly fraction circles
If I were to do fraction circles heres my 34 and heres my 23
Now remember when we use fraction circles we put another fraction circle on top of it
That kind of gets us to our conversion
Once I teach you how to do conversion and like I said I know some of you already understand how to convert fractions and find equivalent fractions but if youre not quite there then this works
All right
So here if I were to divide this can I put on top of my fraction circle can I put three or fours on top of can I put the thirds on top of the fours
Thats what I did
Okay
Okay
Its not going to be equal though
Its not going to be equal so you cant
Unless
The reason I know why is does three divide into four equally
No
No
No
Okay
Okay
So we can go into something smaller
What about six
Does four go into six equally
No
Does three go into six equally
Yes
Yes so it works for this one but not this one
Okay
Okay
What about 10
No
No
No
For neither right
For neither
Okay
What about 12s
Yes
Okay
Okay
If I had 12 pieces how many are going to fit in one four
How many pieces of a 12
Five
Six
Its three
Remember theyre the pink ones
Three of 12 would fit
Now I have one two three four five six seven eight nine
This 34 is equivalent to 912
Yes
You get that later from that number if you convert it by if you multiply four by three equals 12  of nine
Yes because you did 34 x 3 then that equals 912
We are going to do that in the next fraction unit
Okay
Okay
Now how many 12s are going to fit in this piece
A third is bigger than fourth so it has to be more than three
Piper
Four
Four
Now if you were doing this you could actually get the fraction circles to help you because then youll know for sure
Okay
Okay
So now I have one two three four five six seven eight
This is 812
So 23 equals 812
Lydia asked me she said Isnt 34 and 23 equivalent
Theyre pretty close arent they
Theyre pretty close but 34 is a little bit bigger
Its 112 bigger than two thirds
A little bit
Okay
Okay
A little bit
Okay now that I have fractions that are the same have the same denominator I can now add them
My denominator is going to be what
Twelve
Twelve because we never add the denominator
We have to have a common denominator to add the numerator
So 8  9 is
Seventeen
Seventeen
Okay
Okay
12s tells me what
Okay
Okay
How did we get this one inside 12
What did we do here
Madelien do you know what we did here
From here to here
Okay
So you added 812 and 912 equals so you have 1712 but thats an improper fraction
You have to take away 12 from the 17 and then you are left with 512 after that
Then it would also be a whole because you had to take for 12 and 12 is whole
Okay
Okay
Good
Now she did it a different way than I would but her way works
What does this line mean Lydia
Is it dividing
Its division
So 12 into 17 if I divide this Im going to end up exactly with what Madelien said 12 goes into 17 how many times
One
One
Theres my whole
Then I need to subtract 12 from the 17
Five
Thats my numerator and heres my denominator or you bring it over either way
Yes I have 1 and 512 is that how much spinach
No
No because what am I missing
I have this  what else am I missing
I know
Allan get a wipe
I will
Take care of that
That is
Okay
Okay
Were giving Leonardo some think time
The numbers
Leonardo you need some help
I dont think
Okay
Okay
Well this isnt really a fraction but what we have to do if were not understanding fractions lets make sure that were fully paying attention so we do understand it because Were doing a math problem honey
Is this Spanish
What do you think were doing
Think ask somebody to help you
You leave the five and then you do five plus the one equals six and then you just bring over 512
Okay
Okay
Heres lots of information to put on your note sheet
You write down whats going to help you
Casey I better see something on your paper because you didnt even take this test because you were in Mr Cs class
There better be some notes on your paper
Okay
Okay
Julia did you get number four right
The first part yes
Second part
Okay
Okay
Were doing number four Anybody else get number four right
Yes
I got it right
I just needed more
I got it right
Okay
Okay
If you got number four right
Then you can get a computer and go start the decimal stuff in Khan Academy
Okay
Okay
Miss Carroll what if
I got a bunch of work to do
for my number four problem
I dont know
Do you feel like you need to hear
No probably not
Okay
Okay
Well maybe you can listen while youre when we get to they why part
Does everybody have this
Casey
Do you have what you want from here
Ive got a bit of a problem
What
What
Its not in the computer
Theres none
Theres none available
Okay
Okay
In either cart
I dont know where cart nine is
Maybe peak in the classrooms and see if theres an extra if theres any extras because usually we dont need all 30
Okay
Okay
So are we good here
No
I should keep this on my desk
Yes for right now
They said theres no computer
Theyre looking to see if theres any extras somewhere
All right
Ash did you take notes
Yes
You what
Okay were doing more together
Do you have number three
I got number three done
Okay
Okay
Casey you do too
Yes
I can erase it or not yet
What
What
Okay
Okay
While Caseys finish writing did you get what you wanted
You didnt even write the right answer
Youre saying youre having a hard time with fractions and Im giving you the answer and this is your note catcher
Okay
Okay
While I have some people writing what is on the board lets talk about number four
Dempsey was solving the problem 1320  25
He got the answer 1115
Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong without calculating the exact answer
Can I say mines funny too
Yes can I say mine
Okay
Okay
Heres what I want you to do
I want you to come up with an explanation with your Lets do a triad three people from your team
Okay
Okay
Then the four of you do it
Okay
Okay
So maybe these three and these three
Come up with an explanation of why
You guys have four you can do four or one person could come over here and then theyd have three and three
Sam what are you doing
Well what is it
The what
It was by the elevator
Is that cart 9
It is
Okay
Okay
Bring it in Devin put it in front of the swivel
I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator
So his answer is wrong
Thats why I said subtract or add
That way youre going to let me know
Okay
Add it
He subtracted it but he subtracted the denominator
Youre working over here
You can work withEverete and Declan
I can just grab and stuff
I dont know what I was thinking
What I wrote I didnt
When we talk about it
Well see
Okay
Okay
In two minutes Im going to hear your explanation
Who are you working with
Okay
Okay
So you make sure  so he can understand whats wrong with it
So Jamen the thing thats wrong with it is that we dont add or subtract the denominator
He added and subtracted the denominator
done with this up here
Yes  is mine wrong
Thats not wrong
You need more
Are you guys done with the board
Im a Barbie girl in a Barbie world
Is everybody at this table done with whats on the board
Is everybody at this table done with whats on the board
Im a Barbie boy in a Barbie
Everybody here are you done with whats on the board
Casey are you done
No
Yes
So were going to talk about some more information
Okay
Okay
Times up
Timer just went off
Okay
Okay
Lets start with team three
I want everyone listening
Team three
So our explanation was I know his answer is wrong because you do not subtract or add the denominator
So his answer is wrong
Okay
Okay
Im going to ask for more and were going to put more than just that
You have something to add
Yes
When he says that the denominator youre not supposed to add or subtract the denominator the reason why is because well its asking Explain how you know Dempseys answer is wrong
Technically when it says he got the answer 1115 he added 20 and 5 or he subtracted 20 minus 5 which got him 15 and youre not supposed to subtract the denominator
Thats what Robert said
I want more
Okay whats your explanation
Okay
Okay
Listening
Do you need your pencil sharpened
Yes
Okay
Okay
Whats your answer
Okay
Okay
So it sounds like were understanding that we dont subtract the denominator
What did the two groups over here say
Okay
Okay
You dont have an answer
Ladies
We are listening
15 minus 12 is going to give you  you have to
Okay
Okay
So you kind of have the same thing
Hey this group here what did you guys say
We didnt quite have an answer yet were trying to figure it out
Hey West
Dont start talking
1540
1540
Yes
Okay
Okay
The question is explain how you know his answer is wrong without calculating it
Did you come up with that part
Okay
Okay
Hey what about this table
We were
I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator
You only subtract the numerator and we only do that if you have the same denominator
Okay
Okay
So kind of the same
Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know
I said I know he is wrong because hes  which makes no sense because you have to get the denominator the same at all times
Okay
Okay
Every single group talked about the denominator
Okay
Okay
Im going to explain something that really doesnt even have to do necessarily with the denominator that is a better answer than just saying that you dont subtract denominators
Thats 100 true
You dont ever subtract denominators
If theyre like if theyre different you do not subtract denominator
You dont add them either
Okay
Okay
That piece Im not disagreeing but heres why what makes it a better answer using your math sense
Okay
Okay
So I have 1320 and I have 25 equals 1115
Okay
Okay
This I just want to tell you that this right here is a little bigger than a half 1320 is a little bigger than a half
25 is a little less than a half so Im almost at 0
Because I didnt have the numbers here
Okay
Okay
Thank you
So because this is bigger than a half a little bit this is a little less than a half my answer is going to be close to 0 if I subtracted a half
1115 is what
Is it equal to a half
Is it bigger than a half
Is it less than a half
Bigger than a half
Okay
Okay
1115 is bigger than a half
So its nowhere near the answer
Its nowhere near zero
I didnt say one thing about my denominators
But definitely wrong too
I know that this is wrong because of taking this number 1320 subtracting 25 my answer should be close to 0 my answer should be a little bigger than 0
But not as big as a half
But less than 12
Okay
Okay
Because everybody talked about denominators heres what I want you to write and I want everyone writing because  you can go over here back now with your paper
You dont have one of these
Get a piece of paper
Okay
Okay
Then Im going to write 1320 is a little bigger than 12 and 25 is a little less than 12
So if I subtracted them
Robert and Piper I also want you to write this on your paper so you have it
Okay
Okay
I know you can do the computer
Do you want us to do it on the back
I want you to do it someplace near number four
back and like four
Okay
Okay
If you subtracted the two fractions the difference See how Im using math language
The difference would be greater
Ms Carroll  not on the board for number four
than 0 but less than 12
I want you writing this note Karen
This is the answer that I was more looking for than just understanding that we dont add or subtract
This is the next level of answer
So with the denominator talking about the denominators if I were to give this I would give it a 25 where this would be more of a 35 answer
But technically most answers are correct
Theyre correct but this is really what were looking for not that you understand you dont have to add or subtract denominators
I want you to understand more about what these fractions represent
Okay
Okay
So I guess what Im saying is knowing that we dont add or subtract denominators is maybe a fourthgrade answer
This is more a fifthgrade answer
Im trying to get you guys to the fifthgrade plus answers
Okay
Okay
Next Wednesday we will actually do possibly I may give you another one two three and four problem on your white paper that you did today
We may practice all four and then well review two more
Well review the other half of number four and number five
When are you going to go over part B of four
Next Wednesday just because of
Because I already corrected it because
Okay
Okay
Just because of time
All right
Okay
Okay
I want everybody writing this
Im not going to erase it
Any other questions on what we did today
Next time youll get the white paper youll see if you did one and two correctly
Okay
Okay
This is just to help us get better
