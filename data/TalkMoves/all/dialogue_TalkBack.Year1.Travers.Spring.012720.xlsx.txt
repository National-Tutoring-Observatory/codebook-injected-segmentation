T and I were just chatting a little bit that its interesting for us to see all of your thinking because there are multiple ways of thinking about these problems and there are multiple ways of solving and getting the same answer
I would like to know if I look at this problem the six and a half because I know that I can do six minus four right but I cant do one twelfth minus seven twelfths it wont work because I only have one twelfth I cant take away seven twelfths
Is there a way that I could change six twelfths to help me
Is there a way for me to change six twelfths
I mean six and one twelfths sorry
How did you get seventy three twelfths
Well twelfth twelfths equals one whole  so I did six by twelve
Then what did you do
Then I
Four and ten and twelve
You know what
You did is exactly what Gavin and T were taking about over here exactly
He changed these two into all twelfths before he subtracted them and that would work
Is there a different thing that we could do
Alyssa
I did six twelfths so I did twelve twelfths and twelve twelfths plus twelve twelfths plus twelve twelfths plus twelve twelfths plus twelve twelfths and then I did plus one twelfth minus twelve twelfths minus twelve twelfths minus twelve twelfths and then I did minus seven twelfths
She broke then all into twelfths
Then I at the top I minused the four and then I took off a fifth one and then I did seven plus what equals twelve which is five so I put it at five twelfths
Then I did five twelfths plus one twelfth to get one and sixth twelfths
Okay now can I show you something
What if I treated one of these wholes what if I took a whole away from this and made it twelve twelfths
What you could do is you could take off two wholes and make it four and then you could minus the four
Okay so I want you to look at this
Is five plus twelve twelfths going to give me six
Lindon eyes up here buddy
Five plus twelve twelfths is going to give me six right plus I have another twelfth here so how many twelfths is that
Right so now watch
I have five and thirteen twelfths now can I subtract my fractions
Look at that
Okay so now I have five and thirteen twelfths minus four and seven twelfths
I can subtract those now right
Okay so whats my answer
Five minus four is
One and thirteen minus seven is
I want you to look again at what I did because I couldnt do one minus seven I had to take this and I had to trade in one of my wholes
I had to break my whole up just like I did with that one when I had the circles here
I broke it up into fourths so I could take some away
Its the same as this
I took one of my wholes and broke it into twelve pieces and then I figured out six and one twelfth is the same as five and thirteen twelfths
I had to turn it into an improper fraction and then I subtract it
T do you have anything you want to add to that
Yes because I think about it in just a little bit of a different way
Do you want to see how I think about it
I think you think about it like Dylan did because you shared  Gavin
Just like Alyssa did
Yes because if you have twelve twelfths six times thats the same as six wholes
Yes
No
We should try it on another one
Were getting it
Wait wait wait what
Guys still need three more
I need twelve twelfths six times
And twelve times six is seventy two
Plus another one twelfth yes
So you had seventy three twelfths right
Thats how I just did it with Gavin
This is seventy three twelfths written out broken down
Thats exactly what Alyssa did too
Guys do you see the way that I would think of it versus the way T would think of it the way that Alyssa Dylan Gavin my brain thinks differently and thats okay because we would all end up at the same answer right
I think lets go to the next one
Yes
How do you feel about doing them pair up and they talk about it with
Sure so this was the last one on here but we can do it in their journals
Do you think theyre going to need their board to do the work
There is a spot in here
Let me make sure theres enough space
Yes theres some space in here so T do you want to write page 171 up there
Up here
Yes
Its all right you can just write it
You know what I can do I can pull up the journal page on here
Heres the thing you might or might not use your board you could erase it
Were going to have to do another follow up but its a journal follow up
Oh yes page 171
This is a journal problem and it looks like they have gave you space in your journal
If you need your whiteboard you are welcome to still use it
