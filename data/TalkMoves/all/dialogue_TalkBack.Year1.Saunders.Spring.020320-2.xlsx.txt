All right ladies and gentlemen we are going to have to set this aside for whatever questions you have you need to make sure youre getting those questions answered this was more just a jump back in and see if youre remembering how to do that can you use the examples to figure out how to do it
We need to move into todays material but hopefully this is a motivation for you to either ask friends ask parents if they know how to do that stuff come to Academic Support so that you know how to do those problems
These are just reminders you already have your test scores how many tests do we have this quarter
Five
Five so weve had two down all right are you happy with your grade and with where youre at
If you are great if not then its time to start choosing to figure out what youre going to do about it
Thats on you to figure that out
If you need help or suggestions let me know but thats on you to work to figure out if you need to change your grade
The homework theres homework for 31 two and three each due by midnight today so thats what the due day it is
Im hoping that you have those four toolkits done if you dont hurry up and get them done
Retaking the HEO2 test you should have that back if you were absent last week when I passed it back just let me know and Ill get it back to you
If you want to do the retake on either the level three or the level four you need to do your test corrections on those two and thats what the pink and the yellow sheets are up here make sure you pick up those and theyre due by Friday
In other words you have Academic Support tomorrow and Thursday to work on those
Academic Support for math threeblock is both in here and in D2O5 so either of those two rooms
Our test on this unit is February 12th and it is a Wednesday and you really got to know your material in order to finish the test on time there so dont delay
If you cant sit down and know what to do with these division problems like you have sitting in front of you youre going to be in a world of hurt because if you spend 20 minutes on a division problem on the test you will not get to other things
Youve got to be able to look at these problems and get them done within a few minutes time and thats going to be true for a lot of different things
Today were going to go over a lot of different factoring strategies youve got to be able to stay on top of it
We do move quickly theres not really too much I can do about the moving quickly part but Im here to help you as we go through it
Questions or comments on any of that
Yes sir
I have a question about the
You do because the format if you look at the very top of the page in 33 it shows its XK is the factor if youre dividing by X2 and you were to write it in the X minus format you would have to put a 2 there so yes it is the opposite value so when you set up you got to put the 2 for this particular example
All right cool
Already page 75 in your journal were going to start in the journal with page 75
In Academic Support tomorrow I do have the answers to those purple sheets if you end up wanting to come check answers Ill have this available tomorrow during Academic Support
All right page 75 our essential question is pretty short were just factoring polynomials
Remember a polynomial could be as simple as this or maybe as complex as this
For this particular polynomial what root do I have
What Xintercept is this represent
Zero
An X of zero this would be an Xintercept of
and
Five
And
did I hear 6
Yes
All right and whats going to happen here at 1 for this particular one
It bounces
It bounces it touches the Xaxis then just goes right back off of it it does not go through it any even exponent means that I bounce off of that
Whats the degree of this polynomial right here
Two
Two
Two
I havent heard the right answer yet
Five
Two
Five
Five because one two three four five all right because this is a repeated root
So thats a degree five is it positive or negative
Positive
Positive
Positive so that means my general direction my end behavior is increasing its probably something like one two three four five something like that with Xintercepts
Lets see lets go over here we said if youve got an Xintercept at 0 1 it is skinny then five and 6 and we have to bounce at this guy
My squiggle up at the top says Im going to do something like this I have to bounce off of that guy then Im going to go down through that and its going to go up like that
Say it a little louder
How can we only bounce off in the middle
Because its a repeated root and see the square there I have X1 and X1 when I have it repeated it bounces
Think about the vertex form do you remember when we had our vertex form AXHK and this guy was squared
Its a repeated thing and it would bounce on that in this particular case
If you have three its going to be just like these that just have a one on them it is going to go through so two four six eight it bounces
One three five seven nine itll go through the Xaxis
We will call this sketch because we dont really know how high these peaks are but we just have the Xintercepts and we use that along with the information about end behavior
Lets figure out how we can factor those by starting here
Oh I dont want you to see the answers yet
In this first one youre going to look at these equations and figure out which matches with it if I look at this guy this guys A what function family
Quadratic
Quadratics are in the shape of a parabola somebody saying its C could it be are any of these a parabola
No
No hes right it does have to be C now the next thing that it asks is to use the Xintercepts looking at C what are my two Xintercepts
1 and 4
1 and 4
When I write an equation for this what do I do with those two numbers
X1 up top
Thats as much as youre going to do with each one of those
Obviously thats the easy one because there was only one quadratic and there are one two three that are degree three a couple that degree four
Think about how youre going to much those up and have conversations with your partner you guys should be making decisions together as you go
Have those conversations and work through the rest of those
Youre going to  Youre going to use those  to write the equation
You are not factoring this you are looking at this to create the factors
Do we stand up when we are done
You are done already
You have to write the factored form
See how I wrote the factored form
Dont forget that part
How many partners are done
Just a few all right
If you and your partner feel confident about your answers then make sure at least one of you has a graphing calculator and youre going to use the graphing calculator to find the Xintercepts for exploration two
Graphing calculator youll put the equation in use your calculator to find the Xintercepts and write your factored form equation
If you put this into Y1 and your factored form in Y2 theyre better to trace each other
Thats how you can check your answer
Instead of multiplying you actually put both of them in the calculator and see if they overlap each other
Graphing calculators if youre done with exploration one
Yes good question
They both have 0 0 as our next intercept
They actually have different X intercepts it looks like 1 here and 2 here
If I put 1 into the two equations and its this one and this one those two so this one looks easier only two terms
If I put 1 in if I get 0 then its up
If I put 1 in and I get a positive Y value its down
You just plug in a point
Well thats X2 4 if you multiply it out
If you leave it like that its totally fine
Were leaving it like that or
Yes because you want to see all the factors listed out like that
Since its X3 would say there are like for Xs including this one or would it be three because
The degree of the equation is simply the highest exploration whatever the biggest exponent is
It does
If its degree 3
What else did you use to like
The equation
Keep plugging a point
If you are comparing two graphs with two equations find a point that they dont have a
What axis is that one
What do we call that vertical axis
Whats that called
It doesnt have a letter
We have a Yintercept
If the Yintercept is 0
Whats the last thing that isnt there in the equation
Whats true about that 2
Thats the Yintercept
then its zero
We can tell
Thats crossing at and that is crossing at and that one is crossing at the Yintercept
Theres two that have the same Yintercepts
Whats the yintercept here
And whats the yintercept here
Wheres one that has a 2
thats cubic because its got three directions
Go ahead and answer the two questions for the communicate your answer
It hasnt been decided
I think you will have a calculator for the level three and four but for the twos
Dont quote me on that yet because we havent finalized the test
How do you enter a 4 as the Xcoordinate
We only have this put in the square but if you hit the  thats what it does
Guys youre done
Go ahead and answer three and four and then you are done there
You guys are stuck
Seems like youre waiting for the other person to do something
You dont have a graphing calculator
You got to type in the equation
Type in the equation  So look at the graph  Go ahead and write that down  Now Im going to show you something neat
Send the cursor all the way over to the far left
Now watch what happens when you hit enter
See how its thicker
All right so now hit graph
Now the thicker line should go right over top what you have
That way you know that they match
There you go
All right ladies and gentlemen answers three and four if youre done with exploration two
Lets see
I got that right
Got that right
Do we have to go outside in the snow
What were doing is just the X is good but is that what were supposed to do if X is 0
Yes perfect
You could always show your work right
X  0 but then youre dont have to leave that for your final answer
So we just leave this as our final answer
Yes
Yes
Yes we got it right
Yes in a bit
All right ladies and gentlemen the toolkit for today this is how were going to get started
Lets go ahead and open up your toolkit
This is the fifth toolkit and were going to get started on this
May I use the restroom
After youll wait until after Im passing through
Welcome back
Ms Saunders
Yes
Yes
How do you do
Ill come show you in a sec
Just a minute
Ms Saunders one thing  one but what do you do when you get a Y intercept
Obviously with that you can factor an X out of it  otherwise you cant factor it right
look for a different common factor
Yes and were going to go over some different options
It will be its not right now but it will be  even better
All right does everybody have at least this first couple of bullets
Yes
Youre at least down to this area because I want to scroll it up so you can see one more thing right here
This first part of this toolkit are the things from math two that you should have gotten pretty good at
If you didnt master them nows the time to make sure you understand how to do these
All of these titles that are underlined here you could do an internet search for practice worksheets in fact all of those probably have a Kuta software KUTA Kuta software practice sheet
If theres any of those that youre a little unsure of just search by this title see what kind of worksheets they have if its a Kuta worksheet you know that theyll include the answers with them so you can get some practice
Any of these that youre writing down now these need to be solid for the test because really what were going to be doing is building on them
Then of course you can come in during the Academic Support and we can work some together too
The last one is probably the one that I would assume that everybodys the weakest on is being able to recognize that this is actually a repeated factor both of these its the repeated factor
the first one
The cube
You have to do this
Maybe it mightve been the first thing you wrote down at the top you should always do that first in this case is there a common factor
No
When I look at these three terms what do they have in common
X
Yes when I pull the x out Im then left with a quadratic then its going to be your trinomial factoring
Thank you all right who needs more time copying this down
All right lets give the rest of you a five minute break and those of you as you finish up you can take a short break
Well start back then at 20 after if you want to step out in the hallway thats fine I do need to know if youre going to go down the hallway to go to the bathroom or get a drink let me know because I dont want a lot of people going down there and make sure you stay down to the left of our door here just so that were not bothering the other classes
Yes then you use parentheses
Yes perfect
Oh you could do factor by grouping
How else would you do it
Since A is 1 its also the factors of C that add up to B that would give it to me right away
Wait so then we just group
If I looked at this and applied this idea
Yes so x4 its your factor form
There you go
Can I go to the bathroom
Yes go ahead  example two the difference  Oh you know what
Im confused about how to do that one too because its missing something  yes go ahead  its supposed to be 25 in other words if its two squares then I should be able to write each term as a square
Whats the square root of 25
What would be the square root of x6  so I can write that as 2  right but powered to a power What do I do with the exponent
Multiply
Multiply so 3 times 2 gives me six then over here
Now I want to write this one as something squared 8X2
A power to a power means that that would be X to the fourth and 8 times 8 is 64 so that gets me the setup the way its supposed to look then look what happens here its AB and AB in my case thats A and thats B
Then I also have to ask myself though can I now factor this further
Now this applies the difference of two squares which is really what this is about but if I want to keep going
You can factor X2
Yes I can factor X2 out of everything I would do that then keep going and I could have done that over here too I could have looked at what could I factor out first and factor out the X to the fourth then Im left with
All right guys were going to get started
Were going to switch over to the textbook and walk through some examples
The first example is on page 146
Page 146 is going to take that first thing that was in that toolkit that said always think about what you can factor out
If I look at this guy what can I factor out
We see that theres a 2x that can come out of that
Always always always always we want to do that first
Factor out what we can
Got a 2x there
Then I look inside here and my a value is one
Remember the A is the quadratic terms coefficient in front
Theres a
What were doing there is simply doing our typical factoring that we do
Factors of c that add up to b
Were right here we factored out the 2x
My a value is 1 b is 6 the c is 9
The factors of nine
I can just start with one and nine two is not three and three
Thats pretty much it and then Im going to have 1 9 3 3
Which one adds up to the b value
That right there
Notice its a repeated thing
I can write it as x32
What do I know thats going to happen on the xintercept at a x value of 3
Going to bounce
Going to bounce
This is this is very similar to the types of factoring problems you would have had in math II
Any particular questions on that one
Lets look at example 2
Finding zeros of a polynomial function again zeros xintercepts roots all mean the same thing
In this case it says find the zeros and then sketch the graph
Starting with this guy again asking that question anything I can factor out
Factor out that 2
What did I have to recognize right there
One
This right here is a pattern that were supposed to recognize
What is that pattern thats there
Its a perfect square
Its a perfect square
Flip over to page 121 I think it is
Sorry page 121
Page 121
I think thats it
Yes
Yes
On page 121 it talks about a perfect square trinomial
How do I need to rewrite this so that I see the pattern
How should I rewrite x to the fourth so that I see that pattern
x2
x2
Squared
What do you think
When we look at the pattern
Im looking at the square of a binomial and theres something squared
Then it says its 2ab thats the template
What did we just find right here
Is that a or b right here
It says a2
Lets write it up a2 2ab ab2 is that right
Thats the pattern
What does that look like then here
I have to take this I have to recognize that my a is an x2
Now here how can I write 16 as something squared
Four
Four
My b value is 4
2xax b gives me What
That value right there
Theres the pattern
Lets start again and walk through it to make sure that youre starting to see this
These two things are perfect squares
If I look at this and go Oh you know what
x to the fourth is a perfect square and so is 16
Lets write this is 42
I noticed two perfect squares right there
I think it might be this
Depends on what happens here
That means my a value is x2
My b value is 4
4x2x 2 gives me that and I can start to see that the patterns there
Then this guy oops not plus
Oh no thats not right even sorry
I was thinking about something
This is a whoops its minus
Ill eventually get there
ab2 which is what we see here
See how those are the repeated roots of those
its recognizing the pattern of a perfect square which then tells me exactly how I can rewrite this
Now we ought to ask the question again
Can I factor this guy
Well thats the difference of two squares
x2 perfect square difference meaning subtraction four I think that might be in this as well
Sum and difference
Look at the very top one in that core concept
Lets say okay I need to recognize this and factor that as x2 and x2
Then as I look at that whole thing I see the repeated factors
I can simplify the way I write that
This as it turns out is a great level three question thats getting at a couple of different factoring skills at once
Recognizing the square here recognizing the difference of two squares there
Its from that concepts on page 121
Any questions on that one
Lets turn back over to page 146
What page
Yes sorry about that
Page 136
All right 136 the first example is actually a whole lot simpler
Were just pulling out whatever common factor we find in this case an x
This gets a little more sophisticated
When I look at this recognizing I have a 3y3 that I could pull out and then looking over here recognizing I have a 5 z2
Thats all this first example is is learning how to pull out the right thing
Then heres the factoring with a is one another factoring where I have the difference of squares
Then recognizing here that pattern that we just got through talking about of a perfect square
If I look at z and 9 those are both perfect squares so z x 3 x 2 gives me the middle term and so I need to start recognizing those patterns so that I can do that
Let me check something really quick
Havent talked about that one yet
Then heres the next pattern we just got through talking about the difference of two squares and this would be the difference of two cubes and this is the sum of two cubes
We can factor a2  b2 this would be the sum of two squares not cubes
Oops I dont want the plus I want the minus
This one there is no factor yet
This one is x
Weve got the sum and difference not only of squares but of cubes but this one cannot be factored so you dont have to worry about trying to factor that
These are also patterns then that we want to start to get accustomed to is recognizing if those are perfect cubes like 8 or y3 then this is the pattern that we follow
Looking here whats the cube root of this
Its 4x whats  1
Its 1
Notice the first step is to rewrite these as cubes instead of keeping it like this
What I want you to do is on that toolkit isthis is the title of the next section on your toolkit so special factoring patterns and theres the sum of two cubes with an example for you to work on there
The first step is to write those in the formula
Its very easy for us to recognize the cube not too tricky here just the a
What would be  27
So 3 x 3 is 9 9 x 3 is 27 just doublechecking
Now I know that according to this little pattern thats my a value that Im going to use here thats my b value
Thats really as much as I can copy from the pattern that I see here thats this pattern
Im adding a and b
Adding a and b those are my as and bs fill that in
My first term in the second parentheses is a2 then Im subtracting multiplying a and b together so the a x 3 3a and then I have to square my b value
Thats following the pattern of the sum of two cubes
The next one is the difference of two cubes
Then talk with your partner
Whats the answer for the difference of two cubes going to be for that example problem
Anybody need more time getting this in the toolkit
Heres a term that youre used to but its a little different application factor by grouping
Factor by grouping is the way that we would factor a quadratic that had an a value that wasnt one
In other words the x2 with something like 4x2 or 6x2 and were trying to figure out how to factor when that a value is not one
The concept is exactly the same but heres an emphasis on this word right there
Hallway partner give some emphasis to that word as you read that little paragraph to your hallway partner
Well done Rach
In this particular one it works but again you understand that its not all of them that this works for but its something we can try
I look at those first two terms what could I factor out
I see its a z2
Whats that
How do you know whats
You can try
If for example you go through all of this and thats a z5 and thats a z7 because those have to be the same then it didnt work
Good question though
Then what can we factor out of the next one
4 and 4
The whole idea here is that I want to come up with those two being the same so that I can pull that out in a sense by itself
After I pull that out what am I left with is the z24
The interesting thing about this one is because I think once we did that we might think Oh were done
This guy right here can be factored because it is the difference of two squares
I have the z2 and the z2 again the difference of squares
Its really important always factor out whatever we can
Always ask yourself can it be factored again
Once I get some factors can it be factored again and you want to keep going
Thats factor by grouping
Heres an example of factor by grouping then
Check with your partner
Did you guys factor and have the same answer
Share with the rest of your team talk to your other teammates
There all four of you come up with the same answer
Any questions on the answer
Yes
Yes
How long were you supposed to do this
Factor by grouping same as when we had an x value factoring a quadratic where the x2 has something other than one like a 6x2
We just simply look at the first two terms
What could you factor out of those two terms
x2
x2
x2
Whats left in the parentheses then
x
x2
You get 1
What could I factor out of that
Whats left
If I take the 9 out I end up with the same thing
Just look at that two x 3 and 2x2
What do they have in common
x2
An x sure
Whats left is x2
Then I ignore those two and I just look at the other two
I can take a 9 out of that
I end up with an x2
Thats the idea
If these are not the same that doesnt work or if you had just taken the nine out and youd look at those two and go Oh I could just take out the negatives and they would match
Now Ive got this x2 then when I take that out what am I left with
x2
Sure
Sure
Now am I done
No
What can be factored here
These are two perfect squares
x3 and x3 that can be factored two perfect squares
Then my x2
Yes go ahead Zak
If you do that
What I did just here
Those are the same
I put it here
Its like Im factoring that out
This is the factor they have in common so Im factoring that out
When I factor the x2 out of this did I write x2 twice
No I just wrote it once
Thats the same thing
If Im going to factor something out of both of them I only write it once because Im multiplying
Im actually taking this and Id be multiplying it both times
Thats in the sense the two times that you write that
When I pull that out theres that and whats left is the x29
x29 once I pull those out
Then this is a perfect square and thats a perfect square
The difference of two squares is factored like that
Lets go to the I think its going to be the last example lets see
This ones a little trickier
Lets see window partner your turn to read
You read this paragraph
No
is that a quadratic
No
Its a line
Its saying that its in a quadratic form
Well Its a line
Whats true about this and this
Theyre both perfect
squares
I can write them as perfect squares so Im just simply taking each of those and Im rewriting them as a square
Now it looks like a quadratic because I have something squared
If its
With a nine square
If its 92 then technically
No because order of operations says I do exponents and then I look at that
Its like your calculator
If you put that into the calculator its going to tell you 81
If you want it to do 9x9 Ive got to put that in parentheses and thats right
This is just the difference of two squares
Its this plus that and this minus that
Thats just what I see right there
Those things thats just the difference of two squares so those are my things that get added and subtracted
Another application of the difference between squares
Then I have to ask myself can any of this get factored further
Remember I told you the sum of two squares cant be factored so that just gets copied but the difference of two squares so now I could rewrite this guy as 2x232 which you see the 2x and the 3 are in the factors there
This was in the form of a difference of two squares like a quadratic
Then the second one is how does that even look like any kind of quadratic
It doesnt
It doesnt does it
No
No but if we go back to rule number one at the top of your toolkit it says always look for the common factor to pull out
Now I look at this guy
That doesnt even look like a quadratic to me
How is that a quadratic
P64p36
A quadratic always has a quadratic term at the start right
Yes
How do I rewrite this
Power to a power I multiply 3x2 is 6 so I just write it in little different forms
Now notice hows theres those little Us in there
Theres something the same about this guy as this guy and what is it
P
Its that p3
Theres a p3 and I have a 5
This okay and then I just add the six on
I wrote my p3 inside parentheses
Thats the use
Now watch
Pay attention
How is this line a quadratic
x25x6
What are the factors of six that add up to five
Three and two
Its not x
Its
p3
If you just look at x25x6x thats a quadratic right
This is two I think
In this particular case my x is really p3
I found that truly by speaking about this how could I rewrite that as a quadratic terms of being square
That is then the last There we goTheres one little other thing that goes in your tool kit
Well get to that tomorrow
This is the next example to put in your tool kit
Polynomials in quadratic form
Lets see
Aubrey here you go
