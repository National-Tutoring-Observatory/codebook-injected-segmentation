All right
Who did the fractions for 15
Liam tell me what you came up with
210 315 420 525
Howd you figure those out
What did you do
By doing 1  1
You added
Yes I did
So you added on the top
What did you do on the bottom
I counted by 5
You counted by 5
Bryce can you restate what you just heard Liam say
What did he do to get 210 and 315
He added
He added what
I didnt hear
You didnt hear him
Liam will you please tell Bryce what you just said
I said that I did it 1  1  1 and then I did
Does that make sense to you how he would get those
Adding ones at the top but counting by fives at the bottom
Yes
That makes sense to you
Katie does that make sense to you
Yes a little bit
Will that work with all fractions
No
Why does it work when we have a one at the top
Because one is a factor of everything
What did you say Maddox
Because one is a factor of everything
Ones a factor of everything
So you can add this one all the time
Did anyone do 24 as their pink problem
Okay Stephan
What I do is I multiplied 2 2 times and I got 4
And then I added by 4 2 times and I got 8
So there was another one that you got because you had to do two for each
Did you get another one
I multiplied 2 x 3 and I got 6
Then I multiplied 4 x 3 and I got 12
Hi
I cant find my new  Where would they be
I put mine up on shelf but I dont know
I checked every one
Are they up on the top of the shelf out here
Thank you
Youre welcome
So Stephan said I multiplied 2 x 2 to get 4 and 4 x 2 to get 8
What did you hear him say about how to get 612
Avery what did you hear Stephan say for him to go from 24 to get to 612
He started here
You multiply 2 x 4
Two times
What would you multiply 2 by to get 6
2 x 4 is 8
Oh
2 x 3
There you go
What did he multiply 4 by to get 12
Also
Also 3
Remember that when youre making an equivalent fraction if youre multiplying the top number and the bottom number by the same thing
So 3 on the bottom 3 on the top
Youre going to get an equivalent fraction
Who did 23 as theirs
The pink problem
Bryce whatd you end up doing
I got 4 out of 6 and 6 out of 9 by doing what was
You did multiples
So you did multiples of 2
Mmhmm
So when you started listing your multiples you need 2 4 6
Yes
Okay
Ryder can you tell me how that makes sense to you
Why did Bryce do multiples
Everything multiple because its like youre doing the same number
Its not the same number but its equivalent to the number
Okay
Any other suggestions on how that could work
Who did 410
Its a green one
Taylor whatd you get as equivalent
120
Okay
Did you do another one
You just did one
How did you get 820
I did 2 x 4 and then 2 x 10
All right
Could you add on and do the next multiple for 410
Jamie
1230
There you go
Good job
So he did multiples times 2
You can do the multiples times 3
Great
Anyone do 312
Rob whatd you get
12 x 2  24 and 3 x 2  6
Okay
So 624
And 12 x 4 is 48 and 3 x 4 is 12
So just doing the number
A book here in the office
Okay Ill send her down in just a little bit
Her down not him down
Your books here
But wait till were done okay
So you did the top number and bottom number times 2 here and times 4 here
So you skipped the most parts which is totally fine
Anyone do 810
Caleb talk to me
I switched the 120200
You did what
Wait no no no
That was not 1620
You were doing the one below
Yes
1620 tell me how you got that
I multiplied 8 x 2 I got 16
Then I did 10 x 2 and I got 20
And then I got 2430
Explain that one
I multiplied 8 x 3 and then 10 x 3
All right
Jade did you do 68
Yes I did
So I got 1216
Explain please
I looked at the my multiplication table and I got the 12 and then I did the 8 the same way
What is that called when youre using your multiplication chart to help you
I dont know whats it called
You found the
I found the product
Theyre called products when you multiply numbers together but when were listing in order the products are the problem
What are those called
Look up there on your poster
See if that helps you
Making your numbers bigger
Multiples
Multiples
You found multiples
What was another equivalent fraction
1824
Okay
Maddox
Another one for
You got one here
One
What
What
I thought you Never mind
Oh you were going for a different one
Yes
Okay can we move forward
Did you do 25100 at all
No
Katie whatd you get for 25100
One is 50200
Then I got 75300
Howd you do those
I did 25 x 2 which equals 50
Then 100 x 2 which is 200
Then I multiplied one more to 25 to get to 75
Same with the 200 to get to 300ths
Okay excellent
Anyone do 16100
Nobody at this middle table did any math
No
Jamie did one
Anyone at this middle table do any math here
We did
I havent heard from you
All right Caleb tell me what you did
I did 120200
Why did you do that
Because I multiplied 60 x 2
I got 120 and then I did 100 x 2
Then
You have another one
Yes
I got 180300
I did that by doing 60 x 3 and 100 x 3
Excellent
Did anyone reduce this down to a smaller fraction
What
Uhuh
Oh hi
I dont want math
Where did that come from
Jeez sorry
Well thats crazy
Technology went a little crazy with me this morning sorry guys
Well its showing up weird isnt it
Its not in my Google Docs this is a Google Doc
Anyway lets try this again
Did anyone reduce that fraction down
If we have 6100 is there a smaller portion that could
What do you think Sophie
Maybe 610
610
Think of your place value tens and hundreds that we were looking at
If you colored in 60 little cubes out of the 100 how many of those would be tenths
Six
Six of them
Theres another way when you have big fractions like this a lot of times you can make them smaller versions or they call it reducing your fraction okay
Any questions on that
Katie
Its not a question but I have another I think for 60100
What
What
6001000
Yes so that would be making it grow bigger
Okay
All right how many of you used your faction circles to help you figure out what piece the third would be if you had three of them
Oh I got a circle
Show me
Show me on your fraction circle what that would be
Yes I didnt have a fraction circle so I did this
Okay the problem says take out your fraction several pieces sort them into colors
If one light blue is a third what one piece would be the whole
How many blue pieces would I need to make the whole thing
I see Alice showing me three fingers I see Katie showing me three fingers
If this one is one of the third this would be two thirds that would be three thirds
What shape is that
Half circle
Its a halfcircle
What color is our half circle
Pink
White
One pink
One pink
One pink
Onethird twothirds threethirds is equal to halfcircle or a pink one
Were not focusing on a full circle being our whole today were thinking outside the box
The whole is going to be a little bit different
Okay so can you show me that on your table
Get your three blues out
You still have fraction circles in your desk
Do you have fraction circles in here
Yes you do
All right the question asked you if one light blue is one third what one piece would be the whole okay
Youre thinking about the top number tells you how many youre focusing on
So were focusing on one of them
Your denominator tells you what
What does the denominator or the bottom number tell you
The whole number
The whole number of pieces it takes
Right now we know the denominator is three
This whole thing is cut into three equal parts
This is one of them that would be two of them that would be three of them
Then its just basically asking you what piece is equal to that
If you lay your halfcircle or your pink piece on there those are equal
Heres your next question
Take out your purple pieces
Remember that theyre different from dark blue so make sure youre getting purple not dark blue
We want this one
The tenths
The tenths
Take out your purple pieces
These arent purple
Rob if you go over to I think its the first column second go down the stairs there are bags of fraction circle pieces you may borrow
There should be four or five  Did everybody find their purple pieces
Yes
All right this is going to be onefourth of a new shape how many of them would we need to make the whole thing
Show me on your fingers
That purple piece is one fourth four four four four four four four four four four four four three four four four four four four
Okay one out of the four pieces it needs this is one of them two of them three of them four of them okay
Is that more or less than what you just had with your light blue pieces
Less
Less why is it less
Stephan why is this onefourth fraction less than this onethird fraction
Its not even to like a half a circle because its missing the orange
Right if I were to lay this on top do you see right here theres some space missing underneath it would not be equal
Theres another group missing so youre right Stephan that would be right
What would the whole be
What would the whole be if I were looking at that would you put on top of that
Think about your different color pieces and leave them out there
That works
Does an orange piece work
Lay your orange piece on top of those four purples
Avery does that work
Yes
It does
Lets see
If I have all four four four  and I put this on top
Is there one single piece thats going to work
Yes
Prove it to me
You say yes you need to prove it to me
One single piece that will fit on all four purples
Do we have anything in between a pink and an orange
No
No and the shape of those four purples is really kind of halfway between a pink and an orange
We might need to use two pieces to cover up those four
Look for pieces where you add two together and it is kind of halfway between those two
You are using the wrong color sweetheart you need this color thats the dark blue use four of these ones instead
Get all four of your purple use four of them honey
I see people trying blues
Katie what did you try
Two fifths
You did two green huh
Lets focus just on the color because when we say fifth that means were thinking of the whole as a full circle
Are we really doing the whole as a full circle right now
No
What is the whole Katie
Two fifths
Two colors
Two greens
Two greens
Pull out two dark greens not light greens but dark greens
We only have three fourth Thats one fourth
There it was sorry
the purple
We try two dark greens
Does everybody see the two dark greens filled up the space of those four purples
These are not friendly to us are they
I wish there were a better tool for us to use than these paper ones that weve got cut out because theyre not very easy to work with
I wish the foam ones
Yes I wish we all had enough foam ones to use
Theyre easier to place together
Youre gonna try your very best today to use your fraction circle pieces to try to get to the whole
Its going to give you a portion of it then you have to try to figure out what the whole piece will be
Were focusing on colors
I have a question for you
If I needed to write an equation to show that this was my onethird how did I get to the whole thing
I had onethird but what else did I do
Alice
You add it to other thirds too
I added another third and another third right
This is a third this is a third this is a third
I added together a third plus a third plus a third what did I end up with
Threethirds
Threethirds I heard Brady say
Threethirds or whats that also called
A whole
One whole
Okay over here before I covered this up one purple was onefourth okay so right here
I had one fourth what did I add together to give me my whole piece
Connor what did I add together
Theres onefourth
I did plus two more fourths and then
I should have how many altogether
Four
Four of them so if I add another fourth okay I could say that
Could I take two of those purple pieces away and swap it out for yellow
I dont know see if that works
No you cant
No it wouldnt work
Could I swap it out for a green
Yes
Yes so remember that were not focusing on what these labels are right now were going to just focus on the color because our whole is not a full circle today
Okay challenging your brain to think outside the box
Very carefully scoot your fraction circle pieces aside
You will use them they are going to be very helpful to you but you want to be able to look at your math journal right now
If you open to page 157 we will do two problems together
Josh tell me which number you want me to do with you today
Number two
Number two okay everyone look at number two
What color piece do we need
Green
A light green
So take up your light greens
Josh tell me what does number two say
If light green is one fourth what is the whole
Aaron that tells me that light green needs how many totals to make the whole
That numerator says one
One and my denominator tells me how many to get to the whole thing
Four
Four of them
So how many light greens should you take out
Four
Four
Sophie what did I just show you on here
This is onefourth and what did I add together
The fourth
Heres one fourth another fourth heres another one
This is what threefourths
Whats this one worth
One
Onefourth plus
Onefourth
Okay did I create my whole
What does that equal
Fourfourths
Fourfourth or one
Now we have to decide what color piece is the whole
Now your job is to try to fit
whatever color will fit onto those four pieces so try them out see if you can figure out what color it might not be just one it might be two somethings
Try them out lay them on top see if you can figure out which one is the whole
Maddox and Katie found it hold your thoughts for just a minute
I dont have that shape in my circle but I do have it in my rectangle
Nope so try it a little bit bigger
Looks like Alice found it Caleb found it Avery found it Alex you found it
All right Caleb what piece did you find that is an equivalent for that whole
Fives
What color
Orange
Orange the orange piece is onethird of a full circle but its really one whole right now
Lets just say that were creating these really fancyshaped desserts
If this piece was a fourth of it we want to know what would be the whole thing well this orange slice this orange piece is the shape of the whole desserts
Maddox
It could be that or also could be two of these
It could be two light blues
Lets see if that works also
You know what Im going to do is lay the greens on top I think that makes it a little bit easier
Deely had a good idea she was doing it this way instead
Do you agree with Maddox
Yes
We could say its equal to one orange or two light blues
I agree with you Maddox that could be the whole
Katie
Three of the dark blues
Three dark blue lets see if that works
Do you agree with Katie that three dark blues could be the whole
Yes
Definitely
All right so you should have one of those choices written into your book
Make that a little bit bigger
Josh chose number two
Lets see whos chosing which other number we work on
Stephan what other number would you like us to do together
Number three
Number three
All right
Oh that ones a good one
Lets read really carefully
Stephan read that
If one light blue is twothirds what is the whole
All right so were considering these twothirds twothirds
If we were to split that in two equal parts each of them would be a third
This is twothirds so we need to think about how are we going to figure out what the other third would be
This is twothirds
Liam tell me what you would do to try to figure out what all threethirds would be
That is twothirds
You guys are still really stuck on thinking about what these fraction pieces mean for a whole circle
Our whole thing is not a full circle anymore were just focusing on the colors of them
This piece right here is two out of the three it takes to make the whole thing but its only one piece
How are you going to figure out how to make three
Alice talk to me what are you thinking
Youll take one light blue piece and take a different color like the light purple and then place it on top and see if thats half of it
Okay so youre trying to find something that would take two pieces to fill that up equally is that
what I hear you say
Yes
Do you hear that
Did you understand that
Nate what did you hear Alice say
That twothirds is equivalent to one of those
Well youre right thats true but what did she say
How is she going to find out what onethird is
If this is twothird how she going to figure out what to do How do you know what one of the thirds is if thats two then put them together into one piece
I said that you take the one light blue and then you take one light purple and its half of it then you might find out that thats onethird and so twothirds
Okay can you now repeat what she said
Yes so one blue is equivalent to two purples
You have to find what two pieces are equivalent to your one blue excellent
Lets see if she was right
She just started with guessing it it may be a purple because its about that same size
Try to see if you can find two pieces that are equal to your one light blue
If you havent raise your hand up high see if that works
Lay them on carefully because you want to make sure
Sophie what two pieces did you use to fill your one light blue
I used two light greens
Two light greens
Raise your hand if you got two light greens
If you didnt try two light greens
on top of your light blue and see if those are the same size
All right well thumbs up if you got two light greens on your one light blue and it worked pretty much
All right now tell me what is one light green worth as a fraction
If it were a full circle what now
Onethird
Alice says onethird
Jen do you agree disagree
Have a question about
I agree
Why do you agree
What is your light blue worth
Twothirds
Twothirds
We decided it took two light greens to equal two thirds
Why is it that Alice says this is worth onethird
Because it is half of twothirds and you have to use one so it will be onethird
Okay so I hear you saying that one of these is half of the twothirds and say what you said then
Since its half of that since its half of twothirds  one
Okay because half of two is one
We have our light blue is two thirds how many of these do we need to add to it to get to the whole
One
Just one of them right
Because twothirds plus onethird equals how much
Threethirds
Threethirds
Now you have another job
Now that you figured that out what piece what color piece is equal to that to make the whole
Lay your color piece on top thats your whole piece right there
You have your twothirds plus your onethird equals threethirds
What color piece to go on top of that shape right there
You have to lay a color on top of both of those pieces to make the whole because right now you have twothirds plus another third
I see John found it
It looks like Jen is testing to make sure she agrees with it
Alice found it Bryce found it Katie found it
It is truly one piece that will fit its not a tricker
Luke which one did you find
Yellow
Its a yellow everyone take your yellow piece out lay it on top of those two is that the same size
Yes
The two thirds plus the one third equals one yellow
Were not focusing on it as being a fourth of the circle were just focusing on it being the whole piece if this is two thirds
These are challenging you have to really use your fraction circle pieces to help you with this so Im going to let you work together on problem number one number four and number five you need to use your fraction circle pieces
Partner up figure it out help each other out I want to hear your answers in 15 minutes
Good how are you
thank you
and its not a whole circle it said its the whole so theyre giving you a fraction of the whole so they are saying if this piece is a fourth whats the fourth so they would have to put four of those together but then it says that this is 25 so this really is going to be
Someone lost their green fraction circle piece
Look at the bottom of it and see whose initials are on there are or number
Thank you Luke
Nope you can work on your own if youd like
Stephan I believe those are yours JS
What color shape it ends up being so if you have one of the fourth  whats the whole
Whats going to be the whole
If you have two of these its equal to that so one what
One half
Nope
One two
One two there you go
You are still thinking of your fraction as the circle we are not doing the whole circle there you go
Pam pam param pam
Pam pam
On problem number one you have one yellow is half so to create the whole thing you would put another yellow
Theyre asking you what piece what one piece if possible is the whole
This is half of a circle
Yes but right now you have a whole thing half and half
What piece is equal to that
One pink
One pink
One pink
Were now not answering one half because if this is the whole this is half
Yes this is half of a circle and weve been talking about if the circle is the whole these are our fractions
Theyre making you get rid of that in your brain which is not very fun because were really used to using that but if this is half of our shape we know we need another half to make a whole if they are asking you which shape is the whole
One pink is the whole
I dont want you to give me other equivalent fractions like  Oh four purples wouldnt equal that  Im asking you what shape is the whole
On number four they give you 25 you have to try to figure out what 15 is so you could do 15 15 15 15 five times to get your whole piece okay
You only have about three more minutes before I ask you for your help in answering this so really try to get number four number five done okay go
Pam pam param pam
Pam pam
Please put your fraction circle pieces back together before you leave your spot so that youre not leaving fraction circle pieces behind
Head back to your desk I know you will be ready to start talking about this when youre sitting quietly ready to share how you came up with your responses go
I am recording those of you who are moving quickly into transition
Put it on the table by you there
Put it on the table by you
Thank you for your quick transitions looking at number one when yellow piece was half of our shape so how many would it take to make the whole thing
Two
Two of them if I put two of them together what color does that equal
Pink one pink
One pink
One pink
One pink
I just did half of it plus another half equaled to two halves or one whole pink okay
They always give you the easy one first dont they
Okay go down to number four they said one dark green is worth 25 talk to me about what I have to do in order to figure out what 55 would be
If this is 25 Maddox what did you do to figure out what 55 would be
We need 25  the half of 25 so what should be 15
You need another 15 right
You need to figure out what one of the 15 will be so Maddox is saying we have to split that dark green into two equal parts so you have to try to find what few pieces fit on that dark green
Was it purple
Was it dark blue
Was it light green
What was it
Avery
Purple
It was a purple right
So two purples fill in one dark green
So one purple is worth what fraction
Maddox told us it was 15
So we can have 25 which would be green plus 25
That one is not cut very well
Which is another green
That gave us 45
Is that the whole thing
Whats the whole thing
55 so then if I add that little purple piece thats the whole shape
What is the whole shape
One pink
One yellow
One yellow
You did the wrong half I thought it was yellow
One pink is the whole shape
Makes sense
Its kinda like doing puzzle work isnt it
Ross you had an awesome question
For number five what did you ask me
So Ross asked do I need to figure out what three pieces go on here
What three pieces would fit on a pink
Luke
The blue
The blue
The lightblue
Three blues on two yellows
Does that work
So if thats 34 how many more of those light blues do I need to make the whole shape
One
Well do I have anything thats that shape
No
Do I have one pink and one light blue
Yes
I do
So in my answer I have one pink plus one light blue
Please dont freak out about this is no something youre going to have to do very often because do we all carry fraction circles in our pockets
No
Theyre just trying to get you to understand that the whole changes
A whole might be a group of things
It might be one full circle
It might be part of another
What we would consider a shape
Right now this is a whole thing
Lets pretend were buying a new couch like a fancy aerodynamic couch
This might be the whole shape of the couch
And we want 34 of it to be in white leather and the other 14 in a different color leather
Red
Red leather okay
So that whole is not a full circle but we would still have to be able to figure out a fraction of it
Okay so right now we have 34 plus one more 14 to give us our whole okay
Ross
How did you do it
So we need one of the light blue ones so one of them
We put two of the dark blue ones and then one purple
So you found different ways to fill up
Interesting interesting interesting
Anyone disagree or see how they did that
What would that fraction be
Thats confusing isnt it
If you had to name that fraction that would be hard to do wouldnt it
Yeah
Because theyre not equal parts there
That would be tricky
All right
Please make sure you grab a homework
You need a template for homework
So you may take a template home
You may take a template home but you have to make sure it to be back
