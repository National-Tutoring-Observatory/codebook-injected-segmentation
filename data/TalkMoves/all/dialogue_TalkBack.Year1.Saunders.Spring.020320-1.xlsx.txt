I had a question about number one
I excel at  and Im very good at
Is that quotient correct
Maybe I dont know if Im slowly solving the problem
No
Okay
You got the right one
Youre looking at problems in number one and thats what you came up with
Yes
Yes
Yes
Not looking good on that
Okay
I think Ill figure it out
All right
I think you did
Thank you
All right
Were on page 75
If you would page 75
Thanks
did I do right
About right
Oh boy
Are you going to use that
Are you going to use that
All right
Page 75
Do you have the essential question same essential question on the top
All right
Weve factored quadratics and now were going to talk about factoring polynomials
So the factored form is also called what
What have we been calling it
Intercept form
Intercept because were finding what kinds of intercepts
Xs
Xintercepts
Okay which are also called roots and then in the calculator theyre called
Zeros
Zeros
Get used to the fact that we use all three terminologies for an Xintercept
A polynomial could be as simple as this one right here or as complex as something like this one here or any of these different combinations
What did we discover about anything that has an even power
That it increases like that or its like that it bounces
It bounces off of the
Xaxis
Xaxis
So it either bounces off or hangs you know but
Does it touch the Xaxis
It touches yes
It touches the Xaxis
That is only for the even exponents
Thats what we want to deal with today is how do we go about factoring something thats not a quadratic
Youre going to start with matching each polynomial
This polynomial youll match that with the graph that it goes with
You want to use the Xintercepts of the graph and then write it in factored form
All right
So youre going to go from the graph to this type of expression here this type of equation
If you have any questions as you work through it let me know have good conversations with your partner work through them same place same time everybodys working together having good conversations
So go
I actually have a question
When youre factoring a cube can I rearrange these terms to make it a different factoring regular thing
how to do that
Well remember that when we did factoring by grouping we actually
So its a different
Its pretty much
Yes
Yes
Its probably not going to work
Its not a skill that you can use
Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that
Okay
So its up to you
Thanks
Yes
I mean Ill work
Match it first because then youre going to use the Xintercepts of the graph to write it in factor form
is exactly the intercept
Yes so do any of these actually bounce off the Xaxis
No but this is
Right but what we were talking about and let me put that back up for you
How do you put your factor in there
is when I have a factor thats
When its a factor
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Isnt B over there
Its rounded out
Its rounded out
Or theres like actually is figure out
Well youre going to first match it with the graph
What Im trying to do is Im trying to figure out the intercepts and then I can match it
But youre going to do the other way around today
But I dont like that
So in other words youre going to look at the degree and probably look at this and figure out which of these graphs goes with that
Then youre going to use the Xintercepts to write it
So thats the sequence today
How do we find the factor
Okay
So I know  quadratics
So anything other than
In terms of the degree of the polynomial
So the direction of this would be similar to the direction of what
If they were
A line
If a line is going like that is this positive or negative
Positive
The degree is
Odd
One and its is an odd number
Right
So you know that thats odd
Thats right
Okay
Right
Then typically if theres one two three directions its a
Okay
How do you do the
So which ones with that and ones with
Im going to come make a case
Is there even a name
Its this little cute bundle of joy
call me Mongoloid Jack
So they both are Okay
Okay
So with these twos do you think it would go with this
Although because they have the Xintercept
So what I would come to is maybe just plug in a
Is there something thats distinct about those two
Both are negative
Yes
Yes
What happens when its negative two
You can probably use that ones going to be a little maybe a little quicker to figure out
All right
So C is
So why is this
to get one of those
C is
Honestly its not too confusing but
Youre right
Death Valley
Death Valley
Do you even know where Death Valley is
Probably its called
Thats like
D is D right
Its called Silicon Valley
Thats like in California
Silicon Valley is
Im talking about Silicon Valley
Anyway Silicon Valley is in California
Im talking about the valley
Youre talking about Death Valley
Death Valley
Yes
Now we have to factor that
Oh boy
I cant wait to visit Yellow Stone National Park
2028
Oh boy
I just cannot wait to see the volcanoes on March 16 2020
Neil over here
Hello Ms
Hello
How do you factor that
Well youre going to match with the graph first and then use those Xintercepts to bring
Ive hit a roadblock
Only I know how you would factor that
You would just take out X
You guys are good
Awesome
All right
Go ahead and do exploration two
No thanks
Its a little different
Ill modify the instructions just a little bit
I like to talk big
Charlottes in the other class
Well thats because I can prove it
Well I dont even know
Ill find out
Somebody did the quiz retake last time and didnt put their name on it
I dont think its probably not
Joel Strahan
All you can do is
What is this one
Whats your middle name
Yes
Its EA Strahan
EA Strahan
Okay
Explanation
Theres somebody who did the quiz retake last time who didnt put their name on it
No
No way
Youre not allowed to apply
I did
I was in
Dont worry about the A value today
No
Youre absolutely right
Yes
Yes
Were not going to solve for A this day
Yes
Yes
do like that
No
You would have to know another point
You can use a Xintercept to check your Xintercept
well talk about it
You use your Xintercept like when were using vertex form or something like that
Okay
Yes
Yes
You mean in terms of putting the exponent
How do you write that
You use the current
No I mean how do you write it in your factor form
Just like you did here
You found an Xintercept of two and negative one
Yes so youre going to graph that and go find the Xintercept
Oh my God
No
Youre just not allowed to do that
What is like a
No
Dont worry about
Ms  at question two
Yes
Yes
Right
So notice it says use a graphing calculator to find the Xintercepts of the graph
No but I would like to know how
Or is it just kind of just Will we have it on the test
Will we have like a graphing calculator
You will get some strategies on graphing
If I asked you to factor this then I would probably give you one of the factors and expect you to do division to find the quadratic and then you know how to factor
Does it have to
Yes
Yes
Well thats enough
Were just going about it from a different angle
What
Its for the recording to capture student conversation
Miss I dont understand
I got you
What do you need help with
Its like I dont
But theres a whole layer of fresh snow
So okay
it was like crossing snow
Even like on the  youre going to walk through that
It was better than
Yes
Yes
Thats
Im just walking on the grass
I walk in the grass too
All right
You guys should be finishing up the first exploration and moving on to the second one
Make sure you read the instructions up here before you start the second
Im totally ready to move on
You have to be very very intuitive
Intuitive
But what if I dont want
How do you do any of that
See I wonder what those buttons do
Hello
People Im sorry because
Its your fault
It too early
I cant wait to
Ive been looking
No
Maybe its fair
I didnt do any of this
I didnt
Were you
I do
All my  gave me Supergirl
Oh my
You know Supergirl
Dude oh my God I got so scared of her
I got bit by a dog once
You can spray it in the forehead and it just sits there  and it likes it too
Yes
while in the house they made me chug a bottle of water where I was like four seconds in four seconds
I was more like my esophagus
esophagus
No
Your esophagus  that
Your esophagus is like
How is it going
Your esophagus is just
There are  until we can see if theres a graphing
Okay
1015 1 of biology to me
Yes
Yes
There are several in there
So we have both
What did you get
What
What is it
Thats X plus zero
Plus 25 square
What happens if he didnt
He didnt even spell it right
Yes
to do that
Okay
Usually thats way too
But she wasnt here
Yes
Thats common knowledge
It is common knowledge thats why I knew it
Im pressing on
So Im going to describe it
Its like and over in your arm
I have to do
Theres a research team at CU Boulder thats developing an app that Ms Saunderss can use to evaluate how well they encourage
So what can I call him
Ill call you
strong student interaction and engagement
I guess Id put it that way
So when I upload the video it evaluates Yes
So they develop an audio and then I get the feedback
I havent figured out how to use the feedback yet
Thatll be my next step
Ive gotten as far as figuring out the technology and making recordings
The next step is to get some value out of it
It kind of remind you
What
Me
Yes
racist
I was born in
The square root of five
I mean thats totally fine if its graphed correctly
What you can do is put both of these into Y1 and Y2 and see if they overlay each other
Explanation two
Yes
All right
If you wrap up investigation two I do want you to do communicating your answers
So go all the way through question four
Okay
What do you need help with
Why your answer is
Oh this one
She said your friend
I mean label you
Thats not true
I was going to be like Oh my gosh
Its going to be like LOL
Bye
Shes just  send me off
Its kind of
You should get one
Its like Okay
I got
my grandmas
Me setting my grandmas screen brightness to zero and telling her I need to  to fix her screen
Thats not real
Not a real
Welcome back
Youre welcome
I am at a total loss
dont know how to help her
Yes
I should probably learn how to manage resources more
Anyways what do you need help with
Well what do you need help with
First of all I didnt read the directions and then
Okay dude
Okay
Fine
Ill actually help you
Ill actually help you
Lets finish this pretty fast and Ill
What are they factoring
I want the factors
Okay
That I guess it changed but we could solve it a different way
What are you doing
GIS
In terms of its factor
Okay
Yes
We check that
Im actually writing it
Well subconsciously you dont need to find the A value
Do you even know how to factor
I know how to factor
I dont know how to do
I thought
I tried to
Okay
I understand like
The only thing that I dont understand is I got  because he told me but how would you figure it out figure out the graph with only that
So thats  another degree
That has three directions
So looking at these we got three cubics
Now whats happening right there
The Xintercept is
Three
The Yintercept is
Zero
How about over here
What is the Yintercept
Zero
Negative one
Actually  two
What
Right
One two
The Yintercept
would have to be true when I look at that cubic that cubic and that cubic what makes those  different
That
Right
So that one we know matches with that but these two theres no constant
We know that the Yintercept has to be zero
So then the question is well how do I distinguish these two
If I pick an X value lets say negative one
It Looks like negative one is an Xintercept of one of them but not the other
If I plug negative one into this and I get zero I know its going to go with that one
If I plug in a negative one and I get a positive one value then I know it matches with that one
You guys got that
It really is
It really is
Im so sorry I have to  because you gave it to me and
Snow day
Thats pretty
I drove to  about 730
X minus X is zero
Yes
There it is
X squared minus
So I thought
I could just
my circle of drive because  on the other side of I25
Okay
So help
What do you mean help
Do I owe you
Okay
I owe you
Im so excited
What
His real name is Danny
No problem
Keep coming back
I could use it for a minute like
All right
Ladies and gentlemen
Lets take that fiveminute break and then were going to get into some of the examples in the textbook
Fiveminute break
I know where China is  whats important right now
Okay
Because thats where were staying away from
Lets go
There you are
pretty soon but  a whole lot of people out
Yes
Yes
I have friends that live in the North Side of Scotland and  photos  see theyre going through
Yesterday
Whats  tomorrow
So today is a high 30 and a low 12
Id like to do this from a experience
No way
Give me your phone
Put that shit in here right now
Dude  listening to the audio
Shit
I was like You know  the sidewalk
You know what I mean
Yes
So basically I was walking  and I couldnt walk
You take a step
So you use those runners or what
The ice
Thats right
on the ice and  on the ice
Except you wouldnt even
I wouldnt slip
Yes
You would
No
I would slide almost
You would slide and then
I was like
My first
All right
Ladies and gentlemen lets get back to our desks
All right
Here are your answers for exploration one and two
So heres your chance to see how you did
What is that
Chubby Cheese
Whats going on
Has everybody had a chance to check exploration one
So making sure
This went up
Okay
There you go Joel how you can answer number three
This is exploration two
Yes
Yes
This is for exploration two now and the communicator answer
He didnt ask
of the question
Whats that
Three equals three
If youre done go ahead and find that section in the textbook 34
34 probably around page 136 I think
One thirtyfive
Page 136 of the textbook
Dont do it like that
boom boom boom boom like you did here
No but I wanted to just switch up the order  because these are about two the right answer
Right
I dont get it
You have both X
All right
Window partner raise your hands
Window partner
Whos the window partner
Window partner
Window partner
All right
Window partner read this paragraph to your  partner
Most of these involved is I think are two squares
Or the difference of
I guess I was talking
Joel okay why do you have to say things that make you
Do you sleep on this side of your head
Is it that why its like
Because there was somebody
You always sleep on that side of your head
Yes
Sometimes I face the wall sometimes I face the window
perspective
What
Yes
Ill draw my room right here
All right
Ladies and gentlemen
Ill draw
Eyes upfront please
This is from the top
Yes
From the top
So a couple of things to pull out of this
Some polynomials can be factored
So for example when you were working this  in some of those division problems and there was a remainder what would that tell you about it being factorable
Yes but if it can be factored then its going to be factored completely when I cant factor anymore basically
Im left with unfactorable parts
So like for example when I look at the answer down here to this first example I cant factor Z plus 3 any further
Right
Its totally factored and so thats where you want to keep asking that question
Can I factor it further
Can I factor it further
Am I done
Particularly now that were looking at some more complex things we want to keep asking ourselves that question
Example 1 finding a common monomial factor which means that theres got to be Ys in every term or X is in every term or Z is in every term
In other words were just simply going to come down and in the case of this first one we can factor out an X
The first step in the second one we could factor out a 3Y3
In this fourth one we could factor out a 5Z2
The first thing we want to do is always see if theres some sort of common factor
Thats another vocabulary term we could use and factor that out
Notice in this case we end up with a quadratic another quadratic another quadratic No
Thats a cubic
What about
No that is a quadratic thank you
I dont have my glasses on
In all of these cases after we factor out that monomial we have a quadratic so we have to use our skills for
You can use synthetic divisions
Then theres synthetic division
Thats on that option as well
Any questions on that example
Thats stuff that we have been doing
Here in the core concept are some pattern
Again these patterns Please dont play with the mic
Okay thatll be all
Thanks
Notice here that weve got the addition or the sum of two cubes or the difference of two cubes the subtraction and notice that the first step in solving those using this pattern is to write them as two cubes
There are some problems that we can look at and we have to learn to see that those are two cubes each of those and then be able to rewrite it in that form
Then I actually know what A and B are
A is 3X and B is this 2 and then we just simply apply the pattern
If we look we can see that if in the sum I keep that sign
If its a difference I keep the subtraction sign and notice the pattern of the quadratic thats left
Its really the same pattern just with that different sign
See that if I was getting a sum that first term is a subtraction and so those are going to be opposite signs in that case
We want to look for that pattern and thats just exactly whats happening here with Example 2
Weve got to recognize that these are two cubes
Rewrite them as cubes and then just simply apply that pattern
Thats one skill for helping you move a little bit more quickly through the test is if you start to recognize those patterns
Pete could you read this for me
For some polynomials you can factor by grouping pairs of terms that are of common monomial factor
The pattern for factoring by grouping is shown below
Weve already done factor by grouping because that was one of our skills for factoring quadratics
Remember we would find the factors of A x C and we would split the linear term
Then we would look for a way of factoring the first terms and the second terms
Ill show you the example
If we end up with a common factor here then I can pull that out as a separate factor and what am I left with
Is the Z2  4
Thats a valid skill for some and thats why I want to emphasize some
Its not one that we can count on because for example what if this had been 19
Well then I wouldnt have been able to do this type of factoring
That is something that we could look at as a strategy but its not going to work all the time
Factoring polynomials in quadratic form
I want to go back to this example recognizing that this is two cubics
Its X3 and 53
When we get to this Example number 4 Im recognizing that I could rewrite something in a quadratic form
For example this is the difference of two perfect squares
Its two perfect squares
Notice how Ive rewritten this term as a square and Ive rewritten this term as a square and then I apply the pattern that we learned with quadratics the difference of two squares
Well thats my A and my B and so I factor those but then I have to ask myself can I factor this
Can I factor that
Well this ends up being another difference of two squares
Thats a perfect square and thats a perfect square so I could factor those
This second example might be a little bit trickier for us to see
We look at this and at first we can find a common factor and so remember thats always the question that we have to ask
Is there a common factor I can pull out
When I look at this how do I go from here to here
I feel like they left out a little intermediate step
We could split the term
How can I rewrite this as a quadratic
In other words a quadratic has something squared
How can I take this P6 and rewrite it as something squared
What would have to go here
This is the reverse of our exponent properties
Im going to put P Whatever I do with this whats a power to a power
What do I have to do with those two exponents
You multiply them
I have to multiply them
What times two is going to give me six
Then notice its as if thats X and thats X
Do they cancel
No
No they dont cancel
Its as if this is X2  5X  6
Okay
What are the factors of six that add up to five
Three and two
Thatll multiply to that then theyll add to that so now if I understand that X is really P3
You can use it to put it back down
Thats whats missing right here is to be able to see that this could be written as a quadratic that I know how to factor because these P3s are here and I can think about them as if they were Xs and I know how to factor that but really the Xs are P3 so I end up rewriting it in this form
Here again theres something new to recognize
Ive got to be able to look at something like this and go Thats a quadratic
Yes Joel
Joel 3P2 is that just transferred down because its not in the quadratic
Right because my X2 here is really P3
Other than the one on the outside theyre always
Yes
Yes
Yes you just copy that down yes because we already factored that out
Then of course I should I ask myself can this be factored
Can that be factored
Theres another new skill is being able to look at something a little more complex and recognize that I can factor it similarly as I did with quadratics
Pete
I cant factor after Exploration 2
All right
Well get there
From Exploration 2
Did you put it in the calculator and find the zeros
Im supposed to do that
Yes that was the instruction use your graph and calculator to find the X intercepts write your factor form that way
Yes it was a little bit shorter way of doing it
The factors theorem hallway partners your turn to read about the factor theorem
Read it slow enough that youre understanding it as you read it as well
Hallway partner you go ahead and do the reading
Lets make sure were getting the big idea here
If I can take something like that purple sheet that you worked on you did some divisions
If I can divide it by something and my remainder is zero then this has to be a factor of it
Its almost like saying if I have 12   3  4 and whats my remainder
12   3  4 with a remainder of
Two
Zero that means that is a factor of that
Now what if I did 12   5
Two with a remainder of two
Two with a remainder of two
Is 5 a factor of 12
No
No thats all this is saying in our complex way of looking at polynomials right now
If I end up with a remainder of zero then whatever Ive divided by has to be a factor
Were going to be looking for that as well
Now that you know how to divide polynomials or were working on mastering that if Im given a potential factor of something then I should be able to divide that into that polynomial and find out if the remainder is zero or not
The other way of doing it well whats always true of an X intercept
Y  0
Y  0
If I plug in two and why would I be plugging in two
Theres
Remember that the form is X  K that means K is two in this case
If I plug two in what should I get for my answer if it was an X intercept
It doesnt equal zero that is not a factor Joel
I have a question
Is it on task
Yes sort of sort of sort of sort of
I figured it wasnt going to be a direct solid yes
Its a little bit
I was thinking I was just plugging in some random values for X on my calculator
When does it get to the point where its a straight line because I got it
Wait vertical or horizontal
Its just the equation is a straight line
It just goes
You mean it doesnt
It has no curve it just
It has no min or max its got a point of inflection
Thats what thats called where it stops
Isnt that the origin
What
Wouldnt that be the origin for that
I dont know if its for that one it could be any place
I just wanted to know why its something to calculate
Except for that it would be if I
Hes talking about if I have I cubic that does this where it does have mins and maxes it just has a point of inflection
No I mean what it does is it goes up line up
It looks like an undefined slope
Ill have to look at that
It has no slope it just shrinks
It looks like a straight but it just hasnt really  because if it was a straight line the slope would be undefined
Its confusing me
I can look at it more closely after we go through these examples
The second part of this particular example is using synthetic division
Im asked to check this guy to see if thats a factor of this
Im dividing this by that
Iif I use synthetic division remember this is in the form X  K I copy down the coefficients to the fourth to the third to the second
Theres no X to the first thats why theres a 0 there and then theres the 25
I do my pattern of synthetic division to check that
Now because my remainder is
Zero
Then thats a factor
Is that how it works
Joel asked me a question earlier with regards to what would be a fair test question
If I have something that the cubic that youre asked to factor it will either be a pattern you recognize
For example you could factor out one of the Xs and youve got a quadratic that you could factor or I might tell you that this is a factor of that polynomial
Then I would ask you to go ahead and do synthetic division or long division either one to end up with something that then you could factor
Well practice some of those
Youre looking through either patterns that weve talked about today or I would give you a factor that you would divide by and what youd be left with is something you would factor
Could be something thats in a quadratic type form could be a quadratic itself
Looking at then this guy this is an example of that
Show that thats a factor
In other words this would be that type of prompt
I have this guy Ive factored that one out and look at what Im left with
Its the difference of two cubes so fair game
We saw earlier we havent mastered it by any chance but we could refer back to it
We recognize that and then we can go through and do the pattern that goes with it
This is where youre given a factor you divide it out were left with something we recognize that we know a pattern for and then we can factor it
Excellent type of test question for dividing polynomials and then heres an application problem
Were going to stop here and go to the extra practice thats in the journal and were going to work on that
A cube is a straight line
Its actually not straight at all
No yes
You  four different times in the window
Is that what it is
Extra practice for
Yes
Yes
I just
Did you know that youre
Yes
Youre right
How are we going to rewrite those
Its and quantity and 3 and 3
What squared equals
This is the difference of two squares thats where we have to learn to recognize
Thats what happens when you factor the difference of two squares
Then this is also the difference of two squares
Theres no factoring the sum of
