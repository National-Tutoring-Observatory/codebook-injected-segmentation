Thank you for being ready and patient reSSy I appreciate it
I feel like I have so many things to go  technology and SS that
Lets just renew our learning intention like we did together please
Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions with some unlike denominators using a multiplication rule
Thats so wordy
I want you to think for a minute what does this mean that you actuSSy are doing today
I want you to think about why are you doing that
Whats the point of being able to do this
Just to let you know Mrs Sharp  taught this yesterday and just discovered SS the benefits so this is day two of this
When you have an idea of what this actuSSy means youre doing and why youve thought through the why do a standup hand up pair up
30 seconds your response together
Ready do
Siena was the one who taught me how to multiply fractions in fourth grade now Im going to make her teach me how to divide fractions
Why
She knows how to do both and Im going to make her teach me
Lets hear the reason that we would add and subtract fractions with a different denominator
Why do we have to be able to do that
Max
Its because we need a
Whats the reason to learning this
Were adding and subtracting fractions that have different denominators why do you need to be able to do that
Who was your partner
Cooper and Sheila
Okay so maybe Cooper and Sheila can help give an idea here
No just give an idea
Because were learning this so which is can kind of
Well I dont know
Why is it in the real world that we would need to do this
Were doing this because lets say in the real world you dont have what  youre saying like you dont have the same Theyre too different
Like
Are SS fractions that we add and subtract going to have the same common denominators
No
Now were SS shaking our heads
Why would you want to be able to add like this the wording of this needs to be modified okay
It definitely needs to be modified but why do you have to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
Ive just given you a hint Marcus
Why
We just now SS said not SS fractions that were adding and subtracting have the same denominators so why do you have to find a common denominator
So it is easier to just subtract them
What do you guys think of his thinking
I think there are some people who kinda going  and some people going yes
You see somebody doing this that means that they probably dont agree with part of that right
Why do you not necessarily totSSy agree with that Hunter
I lost it
What
I lost my answer
I think you need to talk with your teams again
Youre going to talk at your teams
What is the relMaureennce of learning this why do we want to learn this
Be prepared to share your answer a whole group
Kids I like the way the room has quieted down to an natural quiet when you were done thank you
Marcus are you better prepared to answer this now
SS right Marcus is going to explain the relMaureennce of this to us
We said that my team thinks that it be easier to add and subtract it when you have a common denominator with it
Repeat that for Marcuss thinking
I hear you saying that its easier
Im wondering if it is only easier or do you have to have a common denominator to add and subtract fractions
What do you think
Does that just make it easier or do you have to have a common denominator to add and subtract fractions
Talk with your face partner partner B goes first
Hunter is it just easier or do you have to have a common denominator
Me and Clyde said its sort of a little bit of both
Its a little bit because you have to have a common denominator
This should say Today I will use equivalent fractions to find common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fraction problems
BasicSSy you have to be able to add and subtract fractions that have different denominators
Do you have to find a common denominator and do we need to go back and review what common means
Lets look at this slide
Common read it with me
Finding fractions that are the same
I said think about when we say we have something in common like Nikeel and I were talking this morning about our pets and what was going on with your dog
He was sleeping on me and I had to get up and it was super hard
How big is your dog
Hes as big as you are practicSSy right
Yes
Hes this huge dog and I said to him Oh my gosh the same thing happened to me last night because the princess wanted to just sit on my chest SS night and Im like Gee I love you but mummy has to go do some work and I could take the sevenpound cat off me and go get my work done
It was more a mental guilt for me but did we have that in common that our pets wanted to sleep with us
Yes
Do we have to have that in common
No
Some of you are going This doesnt relate to me at SS but for fractions we keep saying they have to have this common denominator that means that denominator has to be
Equal
Equal
I like the way you keep going to equal or another word would that will be
Same
Equivalent
Same or Equivalent
The common denominator do you have to have a common denominator
Were going to come back to this conversation at the end of the lesson
SS right
After youve worked with it a little more
The other word that we thought you might need to make sure you understand is unlike
Those three words
Lets read what it says about unlike ready go
For fractions to be unlike they have to have different numbers in the denominator
Here is the graphic they chose youll see how this is showing fractions and this with a diagram to show that
Talk with your partner about how these are unlike fractions
Its partner As turn to talk first face partners
Ready go
How are those two fractions unlike
Royce
They have different denominators and if you look on the picture theyre different size box for onesixth and onetwelfth
What do you guys think he was his thinking
Thank you
Thank you
I like the way you noticed they dont have the same denominator and I like the way you related it to our illustration
Thats why theyre unlike and thats why we keep talking about we want a denominator thats the same
Lets go back then to the success criteria
Lets read this
I will know Im successful when I can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions
Show me a gesture that shows the equivalent fractions
Good everybody is showing me equals
You have to be able to use a multiplication rule show me a gesture for multiplication rule maybe
Yes the multiplication rule will help us get those equivalent fractions
Thats what were doing today
SS right
Lets go back yesterday we were doing some slate with benchmarks
Think for a minute benchmarks were zero onehalf and onewhole
When we were estimating and we were trying to decide which benchmark our answer was closest to we were estimating like what do we think the whole answer is going to be when we were saying which benchmark is our answer closest to
SS right
Weve been through SS of these so we are going to do a couple more to refresh our memories
I saw a lot of people yesterday write zero onehalf and one on their slate
Then well align them
Im trying to decide just like thats what would be closest to
Can we look at this one
Onefourth minus onetwelfth
Which benchmark is that closest to
Flash
Thank you
Thank you
You are going to talk to your face partner its partner Bs turn to explain why this is what they said
Partner B ready go
Thank you
Thank you
River can you explain to us how you got zero
I got zero because I know onefourth is equivalent to threetwelfths and it would equal zero anyway because onefourth is smSS and threetwelfths is also smSS so if you round its going to be anywhere close to zero
Who has a different way of explaining that
How they knew their answer
Cooper
What me and Nikeel said we said that onefourth is between zero and onehalf then if youre subtracting threetwelfths from that onefourth its going to be closer to zero because youre already in the half and if youre subtracting its going to be closer to zero
Thank you
Thank you
Anybody have a different way of explaining it
Okay thank you
Lets try one more
I dont think we did this one yesterday
One and a half minus onethird
See some people making drawings on their slates thats a great strategy
That helps you to process that
Its the same benchmarks
Flash
Again you are going to talk with your face partner gain and partner A starts to explain their thinking
Onehalf minus anything would be closer to one
Thank you
Thank you
I like the way I can see people using vocabulary
Cooper B can you explain your thinking please
I said a one whole because if you do onethird to onehalf its only a way because of a little bit smSS
I took only a little bit more than one whole and since its over one whole
You want to show us a model
You want to make something like fraction circles are right there
Im lost and I need Im struggling Im trying reSSy hard  anything about what the speaker is saying but Im still lost
Cooper do you want to approach
Yes
Maybe SS of us could try making something even make an illustration or use the fraction circles make something that proves your thinking for you
Make something
We saw yesterday  easy that helps to show something
Two colors might help you in making an illustration
Can you explain your picture or your model to your face partner and Ive lost count I think its partner
B
B
Thank you for my helpers
Partner B explain your model first
Im learning so much about your understanding here its fascinating
Lets have Cooper explain his thinking using the model youve drawn on the board
Yes
Fabulous
Lets give him a round of applause
I said one because if you take one third and put it on a half its not the same size there is still a little bit more leftover but there is one sixth left over and thats more than a whole
There is nothing above a whole
There is not another benchmark upon the whole so I said one
Using the word benchmark thank you for using that and drawing us that
Thank you
Thank you
I saw a lot of good drawings that were very similar to our models which looked the same thank you very much
Now I want you to think further that how does this strategy help us with our learning intention
How does we using this benchmark idea help us with our learning intention
How does that help us with this work
When you have an idea give me a thumbs up
I want you to keep your thumb up and if somebody doesnt have their thumb up and you have your thumb up that would be a great conversation for you to maybe help them out
SS right
Should two people with no thumbs up get together
No
How is that conversation going to reSSy go
Keep your thumbs up just stand up hand up pair up and talk
How does finding a benchmark help us in solving fractions
Let me know
Thank you
Thank you
How many of you found out some information from your  another partner
Go ahead
Thats why we collaborate
Lets hear somebodys idea of how using a benchmark help us with this learning intention
Hunter
Me and my partner Gary said that so we were solving addition and subtraction problems that today we were solving common denominators to solve addition and subtraction fractions
I agree that thats what were doing and that we were kinda practicing that but Im not sure how the finding a benchmark relates into this
How like the skill of knowing that my answer is closer to zero number one help me with this
Are we supposed to find equivalent fractions
Right I like it that youre still thinking about the learning intention
Good job keep your ears peeled okay
How does this help us with being able to add and subtract fractions correctly
Charlie
Me and Paulina said its kind of like an estimate so like when youre solving and you find an equivalent fraction when you find your actual answer and you can use it to check your work and its kinda realistic
How was your answer different than what you just heard Charlie say
Its because she said it was an estimate and youre supposed to do the estimate and then find the answer and check your work but I said just to find equivalent fractions and to solve equations
Yes you were restating this but you werent thinking Oh how does this skill help me
Theyre so related right
We keep practicing reasonableness and making an estimate as a way of checking reasonableness
SS right give yourselves a pat on the back this is reSSy hard word that youre doing
Im very very proud of you thank you
SS right
Look back at your math journal from yesterday I think it was on page 154
Just refresh your memory about what we were doing yesterday
Im glad you look at that when you check your board
Thank you
Thank you
I like the way I see some people are already on that page looking at it
I want you to look at problem one the table
Just reSSy interact with your shoulder partner and explain what you do
Each one of you will get one of them to go through that whole process with those problems from number one
Partner A will explain first and then partner B will explain the second
When youre both done stand up please
Ready go
Thank you
Thank you
Way to go
Show me how well youre feeling like you can find a common denominator using the multiplication rule
Good
You refreshed your memory with your partner
Today you are going to complete the rest of the journal pages that you didnt have the opportunity to from yesterday
If you and your partner decide to work together you say to describe
If you and your partner feel like Im ready for an independence then you work and chat with this
You need to finish the rest of this page and the next page
When youre finished I have a game for you
Ill put it up on the board and then I know some people are doing nomadic
They can do that also
Questions about what to do
Charlie
Do you have assignment where  game
You and your partner are pretty much going to finish at the same time right
Because youre either thinking and describing or working and checking so youll  partner but
Good question
Any other questions
Ready go
Thank you
Thank you
Thanks for your stopping so quickly
Remember yesterday we were remembering  and where were thinking about the learning we had back then
We were like Hang on
This is not SS brand new
What was the little saying that we said
Whatever you
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
How does that relate to todays work
Lets say it again
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
You could even reverse that right
Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top
How does that relate to the days work and our learning intention this multiplication rule
How do those relate
I am working with somebody right now thats on problem two and they were smart
They were using the number line for their strategy but they were like Theres not another one
Im looking on the number line and Im supposed to come up with four and I need another one
How does this rule Whatever you do to the bottom you do to the top whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
relate
Stick your thumbs up if you know how they relate
How does that rule relate to this work today
Okay
If you have your thumb up and across from you theres somebody with their thumb up then you just share with your partner
If youre the only one with your thumb up you share with your team and see if you can come to some consensus about it SS right
Ready go
Back to me please
Thank you so at this team Sheila her lights just went Oohh
LiterSSy that was her sound
Sheila tell everybody what you figured out
BasicSSy what youre doing is youre doing 2x24 and then 3x26t
Oh
What were you doing there Sheila
What I was doing is basicSSy youre multiplying it by two
Youre multiplying the numerator
And the denominator by two
Okay
I see some people agreeing
I see some people not looking up here and I reSSy want you to notice something
I wrote three is that okay if I wrote three instead
If youre reSSy multiplying the same number the numerator and the denominator by the same number three thirds
This team told me that equals one
What do we know the rule is when you multiply a number by one
Same thing
Its the same number
Are you changing that number
No
Show me an action that shows me the relationship between the new number and the old number
Nice I see some people
Yes youre going to be on the cheer squad someday because cheerleaders do that
Yes they are equivalent
How can you prove that to yourself
How could you prove that SS these numbers like Hunter has one fourth three twelfths two eighths how can you prove that those are SS equivalent
How can you prove that
Popcorn it out whats one way you can prove it
Divide
What do you mean by that
You could see if that number Well maybe multiply that number that fraction you originSSy had to see if it got one of those fractions
We want you to play with this a little bit
How can you prove that multiplying the top and the bottom by the original fraction still gives you an equivalent fraction
Play with that
How can you prove it
You have lots of tools at your desks
You have number lines you have fraction circles you have whiteboards you have  mathematical  you can play with
Prove that youre coming up with an equivalent fraction
Who has a way to prove that using the number line if they can show us
Who has the number line method down
Yay
Do you two want to go up together
Its always nice to have a partner
Lets give them a round of applause for volunteering
Thank you
Thank you
Theyre showing us the number line method
Should you be working on your idea
No
No youre looking at their thinking
The way to do it you have the onefourth you could get a straight line then look down
Can you just show us that straight idea
Theres a ruler in that drawer to your left
Right there
Open till the top drawer
Its the top drawer to your left and on the right hand side of the ruler
Do you see it
Its even transparent I think or not
Never mind you found the ruler
Good
Show us that straight line
This part on the four is lined up with the eight and
How do you know then
Because they are lined up on the same place on the number line arent they
They are still equal
Lets give them a round of applause
Who had a different method
Did you figure out your mathematical one
Yes
Can I save the best for last
Yes
Okay thanks
Nadia whats your method
I used the fraction circle
Great
Shes going to head up there
Way to go
Andy do you want to go with your partner
Thank you
We have four sixths and two thirds
If youre ever needing to add them you can see youre trying to add them
You can see that it takes two sixths to make one third
To get to this you would multiply a third like with the same thing on the top and the bottom by two and that would be You can see that they are equal because you have twothirds equals to four sixths because it takes four sixths to get two thirds
Thank you
Thank you
Any questions for them
Everybody sees it
Round of applause
Thank you
Thank you
Anybody besides Breanna have another way
SS right Breanna youre up
Can you prove another there for us
Yes
Round of applause
Yay
Way to go
Should we be building right now
No
equals to three because if you multiply if you do onefourth times two you get two eighths and if its two divided by two eighths If you switch two eighths with a half you get one fourth
Think of what question you want to ask them
Hes got a great picture
Hes got some great explanation but where are you confused because everybodys looking at me
Thats how I know youre confused like Whats T going to say about this
What question would you have for him
I see you have times two up there
It says one fourth equals two eighths and it says times two
What are you trying to say there
Im confused
One fourth multiplied by two is two eighths
When I think about onefourth times two I think about one fourth plus onefourth equals one half
Im thinking that yellow is a fourth and another yellow is a fourth and that equals a pink
Thats what Im thinking when I see that
Do you want to borrow a marker
Somebody even want to hand him a marker because theyre  right there
Thank you
Thank you
Do you want to do a change Natasha
Onefourth is equals to twofourths
Do you want to go work on this and come back
Yes
Okay
You go work on this and come back
Well go back to what we were doing
I was just reminding you when youre multiplying whats our old saying
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
Im trying to prove to you that it equals to one and youre trying to prove to yourself okay
Breannas going to come back to us
Hes working through it
Wherever youre sitting just stay there
My friend Breanna has said to me What did you say Breanna
Hes going to show us
Wherever youre at
Stay there
If you need to demagnify it let me show you
See this subtraction symbol in the final answer
Yes
Thank you
Thank you
The way that I figured it out was if I divide it by two it will be onefourth multiplied by two and you would multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two which would equal to eight
Nice job
What do we cSS what you just did
Everbody think of that
What is that strategy cSSed that were working on today
Its part of our learning intention
Think about it
Say it in your hand
Let it out
Multiplication rule
Yes multiplication rule
Thats why I said You
because this is the multiplication rule
Multiplication rule is to do what
Multiply
Whatever you do to the top
You do to the bottom
Nicely done
Stay right where youre at
Lets give Breanna a round of applause
You have determination
It can be rattling to think you know what youre doing and then get up and not
Good job not getting rattled
Look up here please
Think about question one
Read it with me
Read it with me
Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
Think about that
This back to what we were talking about
Remember we said wed come back to this
Why would it be difficult to add and subtract functions with unlike denominators
People on the rug get a novel partner please
People here
Laura you can come and talk with Maureen please
Youre going to talk with your partner
Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
You can start with the center screen
It is difficult because
It is difficult because
I should thank you
Why is it difficult Wendy
Because you cant automaticSSy say Well one half plus one half is one
You have to use multiple strategies and to check your work and find common denominators
Okay
I like your thinking
I can tell you tried but its not exactly answering this question
Lets go back to this question
Why is it difficult to add and subtract fractions with unlike denominators
Elijah
Its difficult because theyre not the same denominator and you wont know
If its three sixths plus onefourth or onefourth minus three sixths or something like that its difficult because you have to figure out a common denominator for it
Theyre not equivalent at first
Denominators are different so its harder because theyre bigger fractions and theres smSSer fractions of each other
Its a less efficient way with different denominators as well because you have to get fraction circles and actuSSy work a long time to actuSSy be able to figure out the right answer
Harriet you want to connect
I agree with everything he said
Id like to add theyre different sizes so you have one fourths plus three sixths threesixths is going to be way bigger than onefourth
This is tricky to explain
It is tricky to explain
I was thinking when I wanted to explain it Id say Its like theyre in two different units
You know how you talked about miles and kilometers
Theyre both units of measurement but theyre different measuring standards
Kilometer is a different metric and then theres US standard You have to put them in the same form in order to add and subtract with them so that theyre in the same unit
I dont know
Thats a tricky one to explain
Lets think about number two
Read it with me
Read it with me
How to divide a common denominator using equivalent fractions
Easy
You need to think of one way you can do this
Think about our learning intention
That might be the way that you could talk about If you shared first the last time you share second this time
Ready go
Whats one way to find a common denominator Clay
I have people checked out
They have their math journals put away and their snacks ready to go
Are we for snack time if were not finished with math
No
No we are not
What did we practice today and yesterday to help us find a common denominator Hazel
The multiplication rule
Which is
Which is multiplication
Right
Multiply what
Multiply
The numerator
And denominator
By
By
The same number
Whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
Yes whatever you do to the top you do to the bottom
Thank you Hazel
You did a good job
Rate yourself on how well you can use a multiplication rule to generate equivalent fractions
Thank you
Thank you
If you did not finish these journal pages do you think you should take it at home and do it for homework
Yes
Is it punishment
No
No
Its to help you get ready for the next day
Im going to save the home link for Monday
Just get this back in our heads
Some of you are putting your math journal in your desks some of you are putting it in your homework folders
If you dont understand what the lesson was about should you go back and look at it
Yes
Thank you for your hard work
We can have a snack now
