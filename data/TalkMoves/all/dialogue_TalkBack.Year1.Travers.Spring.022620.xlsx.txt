Im ready for you Logan
All right ladies and gentlemen would you please bring your conversations to a close
Excellent and now I want you to determine for todays work who will be partner A and who will be partner B
Sometimes A will go first sometimes B will go first and if you have three people you will have two people be the A today
Figure that out you have 10 seconds
Who will be A who will be B
Three two one and zero
My friends can I have everybody please take your bodies and move them off the carpet so we can all see the question thats on the board
This is our warmup this is a way that teachers call it building rapport
Making you feel good and comfortable with the person youre about to work with
Our question is if you could go anywhere right now for 30 minutes and not have any responsibility
You wouldnt have to care of a sibling you wouldnt have to do homework you wouldnt have to read
You can do whatever you wanted for 30 minutes anywhere you wanted for 30 minutes where would you go and why
If you are partner A you are going to share first and then partner B youre going to respond
Then partner B youre going share second and partner A you will respond
Im going to tell you when 30 seconds is up and then when the minute is up so that you can keep track of your time
If theres someone who would model do an example with me
Kevin come on up
Im going to pretend like Im partner A youre partner B so do this
Good morning
Good morning
If I could go anywhere for 30 minutes and not have any responsibilities right now if I could magically transport somewhere Id like to go skiing by myself
Why
Because I love skiing but lately when I go skiing its with my daughter and so I dont get to really ski hard like I like to ski
Thats what I would do for 30 minutes if I could have no responsibilities and do whatever I wanted
What would you do
I would go to Fiji to surf
That sounds amazing have you been there
No but Ive been surfing a lot
Really
Where have you been surfing
Off the coast of North Carolina
Awesome
Fiji sounds like a great place
I would agree something like that on the beach with the ocean thatd be my close second
Thanks for being my partner
Now were going to get our materials and we are going to go get started working today
My friends find your thinking partner and partner A your 30 seconds starts now
Let me know when youre ready
Ladies and gentlemen that was 30 seconds switch partner
The other person talks
All right please bring your conversation to a close
Thank you for sharing
I love hearing going around
I heard someone in here would just like to stay in the classroom and have freerunning time in the class
Heres your job
First youre probably going to need to go back to your own desk
Youre going to need to clear hang on freeze youre going to need to clear everything because someone else might be sitting in your desk in a few minutes
I want your desk nice and clean and clear
Youre going to get these materials
Pencil math journals whiteboard marker then you and your thinking partner are going to sit by each other at a table group shoulder to shoulder
Clear or cloudy
Clear as the sky
Are you clear
Yes
All right go
You have about 10 seconds to be in your new seat next to your new partner
You have about five seconds to be in your seat next to your new partner
All right this is what youre going to do with the little carvings youre getting from the back of the room today
This is todays lesson my friends
Using displacement to measure volume
Yes I can call the funny faces
Using displacement to measure volume
Let those words keep on marinating in your head right now
If youre partner A would you please stand up
Partner A would you please read todays learning target
Ready go
Today we will use the displacement method to measure the volume of objects
Okay think about that for a moment
Partner B please stand up
This is our success criteria today
Partner B please read it
I will be successful when I understand how to measure volume by displacement
I will explain why displacement method works for measuring volume
Great
Thats a lot of empty words
Well talk about displacement in a minute but what I want you to talk about first is this what is volume
You should have your whiteboard and watching the clock
Id like you to write down fast and furious if youre wrong or right what do you know about volume
You have 30 seconds go
On the whiteboard because this is where youre supposed to be doing that
On your whiteboard what is volume
A picture some words definition you have 20 seconds
Use your whiteboard
All right you may have your marker still ready
Id like for you to please stand up at your table groups
Were going to do whats called a round drop hit
A single round drop and that means one time around everyone will share something they have written down on their whiteboard
You might have a management at your group
If you do start at teammate number one then two then three then four you might have a five
I want to hear everybody share something that  on their whiteboard and then be ready to share something youve heard in your group
If someone in your team says something and you think Yes thats a great idea jot it down
So have your markers ready and have your tables listening
Is everyone standing
Please stand
When youre done sharing please sit
Thats how Mr Bayer and I will know that everyone has shared
Raise your hand if youre teammate one in your group
Youre starting
Ready
Go
If youve shared you may sit down
Okay well Im going to pull a couple of sticks I want you to share something you heard at your group
What is volume
Nora
It is length times width times height
Im going to teach you something new here
I think weve done something like this before
If you agree youre going to stand up
If you dont agree you stay seated so everybody has to be really listening and everybody has to be ready to respond
Nora would you say that one more time please
The volume is length times width times height
Okay thank you sit down
Another person
Ellie
I dont know which one this is
Okay
The inside of an object
The inside of an object
Take off or stay seated
Do you agree with that explanation of volume
Okay great touch down
Sit down
Aria
Volume is the amount of space an object takes up
Volume is the amount of space an object takes up
Right touch down
Victoria
The measurement inside an object
The measurement inside an object
Are we taking off
Are we standing up
Okay thank you
Naomi
Its
Volume is
Volume is also base times height
Area of the base times height
Stand up
Okay great
Well do one more
Touch down
Logan what do we know about volume
Its the space that an object takes up
The space that an object takes up is what I heard Logan say
Excellent thank you
Okay my friends touch down
I heard some great ideas about volume
What we want to think about is that there are a couple of different ways to come up with volume
Usually when we think about volume we think about this
Like this
The amount of space that a 3D object takes up
This is a rectangular prism or a cube
Did you guys do something on volume yesterday
Yes
The volume would be how many cubic centimeters would fit inside this cube
Thats volume its how much space this takes up
Do we know
A thousand
A thousand how did we know
Base times height
Area of the base so the area of the bottom times the height because theres layers
There will be layers of cubes inside here
The one layer will be the area of the base and then we have 10 of those layers to make the volume
This will be full of 1000 cubes
Do we agree with that
Yes
Okay
I just answered some of those questions
Heres what were going to do
Partner A I want you to find the volume of this partner B youre going to respond would you find it the same way
This is a cube or a rectangular prism how would you find the volume of this rectangular prism
Partner A youre starting partner B you are responding
Ready
Go
Three two one zero voices
Again I heard some great conversation I want to hear from just a couple of you
Sarah
area of the base times height
Why
Because its quite easy
Its efficient quick and easy to find the area of the base
How would you do that
Length of the bottom times
Length times width
Times width
Then times the height
Yes
Okay excellent
Then I just picked Jade
How would you find the volume of this
I would multiply the area of the base multiplied by the height
Right so will that trend always work when you have a rectangular prism or a cube
Yes
It will but I want to really challenge your thinking right now
You see that top picture up there
Yes
Which one of you ever played croquet
Do you know what croquet is
Croquet is this little backyard game where you have a mallet and you have these balls and theyre a little bit heavy and you hit them through a goalpost
I got really lucky because Mr Ms Travers my husband he teaches fifth grade and he just taught this lesson the other day and he said Mrs Ms Travers we are supposed to do this lesson with oranges
He said You dont want to go to the store and buy oranges just use the croquet balls we got
I said Okay
He did it he said it worked really well so yes were going to use croquet balls instead of oranges
We know we have some strategies for trying to get the volume of a prism
A question for you could we use the same strategy for finding the volume of a croquet ball
Im going to pass a couple around you so you can feel them
Could we use the same strategy for finding the volume of a croquet ball
You have a thinking partner
This time partner B is starting first
Partner B what are your thoughts about how will we find the volume of this ball
Partner A you will respond
Go
All right please close your partner station
This time I am going to take some volunteers
I dont usually do hands up and that because I love to just hear what kids are thinking but this is a new idea
What are some of your ideas with this croquet ball
Can we use the same strategy length times width times height to find the volume of the croquet ball
What are your thoughts
Ally Ive not heard from you yet today
You probably could but it might be a little harder because the base area might be like right here on the bottom it might not be the same height or the same width as the whole
Im hearing you say there probably is a formula of some sort to find the volume but it might be a little different because it doesnt have a base the same way a prism does
Yes
Okay
Lydia please call on someone to add on or to share some different thinking
Me and my partner thought that we wouldnt be able to use the same strategy just a little like they said because it doesnt really have a base or size that you could find the length and width of so it would be really hard if we tried to use that strategy
Because of this round size were thinking we wouldnt really be able to find the
A different method
Yes its round so its a lot harder to find the length and width
Could you call someone else to add on
We kind of thought that it wouldnt work
When you say it what do you mean by it
The strategies
To find the volume
Of the base
We kind of thought that you would have to say like you would have to find the square
If theres lines on the croquet balls we thought wed count the lines and those would be like layers and how many cubes
Were going from thinking about how would we find the volume of this
We are kind of leading into that
I want you to do some thinking right now and the same conversation with your partner
How could we find the volume
Well call this a prism
A croquet ball its a prism
A sphere
A sphere
A sphere
A sphere
A sphere
Talk to your partner go
Thank you
May I have your croquet ball please
All right good friends thank you for sharing your great ideas
Im going to go ahead and ask you to turn your eyes up to the front whiteboard
Do you have your whiteboard in front of you
Yes
Clear it off
Today were going to learn a new method for finding volumes
The method is called the displacement method
Say displacement
Displacement
On your whiteboard displacement
The root word is displace
Even displace has a prefix dis
The root word is place
What do you think that word means
Displacement
To share
Quick ideas
Lets just do some quick ideas
Aria
Maybe to put something in the wrong spot
If you displace something like I displaced my car keys I cant find them
Right
Yes
All right Ellie
Maybe if youre playing with Legos and you put it in the wrong spot
Interesting
Are you thinking dis might mean wrong
Yes
Okay anything else
Anything different
Jack
I know that dis it sounds like misplace though its different so it has almost the same meaning
Dis is similar to mis misplace displace
My friends were actually going to be displacing some water with an object
Everyone will get an opportunity to do this today
Eyes back upfront
Today were going to displace objects of water to measure the volume of objects
I have some pitchers
I actually need to pour some of this water
Ms Bayer can you help me pour the water back out back into one of these pitchers so that theres just water at the zero mark
Thank you
My friends what were going to do today is we have a croquet ball and we have a pitcher its a container well call it a pitcher of water
Im going to put the croquet ball in the water
What do you think is going to happen
Based on what you know water does
I love this conversation
Okay three two one zero
Guess what Ive already done some of the work for you
You need to open up to page 214
214 or 215
214 I believe
214
214
May I borrow yours for a minute Maya
Thank you Parker
My friends when you look on page 214 youre going to see the directions
Ive already done some of the directions for you so that we didnt have to use our thinking our learning time making the container
Were going to scroll all the way down
Ms Bayer just did number seven for us
She poured the water out of the bottle until the water was back at zero
Right now we have this
We have a twoliter container
Our container is marked with our measuring tool
That means it is to scale
This is the scale we are using to measure the volume
Our water is up here at the zero mark right now
Im going to put the croquet ball in the bottle
Dont say anything out loud right now
Thats what Im going to do
You have this right here
I believe you have a prediction
This is our calibrated bottle that weve created
This is our tool for measuring volume
Were measuring how much space the croquet ball takes up in the water
Thats what volume is
How do you think this tool could be used to find the volume of My friends in your book do you see where it says orange
Cross out orange write the word ball
Im not using an orange Im using a croquet ball
From the math message this is the math message
What is going to happen when I put the croquet ball in the bottle
Write your prediction go
Start with  thats why we always have two teachers in here  three days in
Im sorry whos journal did I take
Jack you can go take it back
You may go write your own prediction
Yes you could freeze it
How do you freeze it
I got it
You just press
The calibrated bottle is your tool for measuring volume
How can we use this tool to find the volume of our croquet ball
What is going to happen when we put the croquet ball in the model
Write it
Though Im going to be calling kids to share their prediction
You have a prediction
I think
How will we find volume
All right friends you have your same thinking partner
Partner A youre speaking first
Youre going to read your prediction partner B responds
Partner B you read your prediction partner A responds
Ready
Go
Okay and three two one zero
Thank you for bringing your voices back to zero
Lets hear a couple of predictions
Pete
Adam
I thought that the water would rise because the croquet ball would take away space from it so it forces the water to spread out kind of
Do you think you might agree with that prediction
Please stand
Okay touch back down
Lets hear a couple more
Maya
I think the water will rise and show on the scale how much it rises
Maya said I think the water will rise and it will show on the scale how much the water will rise
Would you please stand if you agree
Okay touch down
Well hear one more
Brielle
We mightve thought that when we drop the croquet ball in the water the weight will push it down so itll rise
We know that we started at zero and then well count how much it rose
My friends do you see
Maybe if youre in those far groups you may stand
If youre in these three groups right here would you please just turn your chair so we could see here
My friends I have the container is marked at the yellow
Im going to show you a couple of objects and youre going to be doing a couple on your own back here
Pay attention how Im doing this now
The yellow mark the yellow tape is zero
Thats our measurement for zero
Im going to put in the croquet ball
Just like some of our predictions were going to see what happens
The water is going to rise
How high the water rises will tell us how much space this croquet ball takes up which is what word
It starts with a V
Volume
Ready
It floats
Its between 100 and 200 milliliters
Close to 200
What would you say Adam
I liked your estimate
175
175 milliliters write it down
You have a place right here
Record the volume
Cross out orange again its a croquet ball
Record the volume of the croquet ball
175 milliliters
That means that croquet ball is equal to 175 milliliters
Maya did you want to add something
I noticed that the ball is floating is it still taking up volume of the whole area
Volume
That whole volume up since its not completely in the water
You know what Im going to have you do Im going to have you hang on to that question right here because you are going to measure some other objects today
I just think you can answer your own question by the end of the lesson okay
Okay
All right
Emma Im going to have you put your hand down
Ms Bayer would you mind unfreezing and showing us the next page
Were going to keep going
Jack can you go put your board up
Sorry Ms Bayer Im actually going to have him put the
Sorry
I need page 215 under the top counter
Thank you for being my second and third teacher
Of course
My friends so we all have this recorded
What about a flat
What about base 10 flat
Could we use the same volume method
Maybe
Partner A read number one for us
In your journal its also on the screen
Raise your hand if youre an A
Youre reading number one
Go
Use the displacement method to find the volume in milliliters of one base 10 flat two base 10 flats and three based 10 flats
Record the volumes in volume
In milliliters
Column of the table below
My friends Im going to tell you a hint
Milliliters Im going to put these down and were going to see what happens in milliliters ready
Heres one base 10 flat
Its about a hundred
A hundred milliliters
These are cubic centimeters
They are 100 centimeters that are in a cubeshape in this flat correct
Yes
So we have 100 cubic centimeters one flat is equal to what
A hundred
100 whats going to happen when I put in two
It should right
Three should come up to about 300
Jot that down in your journal
A different chart
Ms Bayer put our key on the board
100 centimeters cubed is equivalent to 100 milliliters so if I have two flats in the water two flats push it up or displaces 200 milliliters of water
Three flats displaces 300 milliliters of water
Another way to find volume is using the displacement method with a scale
Our scale is 100 milliliters
Are you ready for some fun now
Yes
Number three is what do we notice
Look at the table what do we notice
What do you notice about the volume
May I borrow yours now Maya
No you are just fine
I appreciate you helping me with the technology
Here we go
My friend we should have something like this
One base 10 flat is equivalent to 100 milliliters its also equivalent to 100 centimeters cubed
Partner A and partner B look at your partners journal and make sure your partner is caught up with us at this point
What do you notice
Do you see a pattern
Im seeing some yesses some noes
Talk to your A B partner go
Three two one and zero
What is it that we notice
Emma
That each one gets
Are you noticing that one base 10 block has a volume of 100 milliliters
It also has a volume of 100 centimeters cubed
Theyre all equivalent yes
What could we write here for number three fifth graders
What could we write here for what do we notice
Nora
I said I noticed the milliliters and centimeters are equal
They have an equal volume they take up the same amount of space
Would you please check your thinking partners journal
Do each of you have number three complete
Yes
Right
Get that and you get that
I actually have a secondgrade class that needs me at 910 so Im going to tell Ms Bayer about the rest of the lesson
Im going to tell you about the rest of the lesson also and then Im going to have you do the brain break and then finish the lesson
Heres the rest of the lesson
My friends were going to work on math boxes with your thinking partner
Hang on
Ms Bayer is going to call two table groups at a time to come over here to the back table and you are going to try out some different objects in the water
You are going to test out a small can a bigger can a small a medium a larger can
Youre going to test out a golf ball
I even got a pyramid
You have three objects that are you going to test out and you are going to write them down on the middle of page 215
Everybody point to the middle of page 215
You are going to do the displacement for three or four objects but then write down three of them
You are going to do that when you come up with your thinking partner in your groups but its just easier not to have everybody doing it at the same time so youre going to be working on math boxes
Ms Bayer is going to call groups back to measure those
Does that sound okay
Yes
Then my friends youre going to do six and seven with your thinking partner
Ms Bayer MrTtold me he did number eight back together as a whole class because you will be finding an average
What is the average volume of these shapes that weve displaced
Okay so he felt like coming back together to talk to through that with their thinking partner then the whole group would help you do that and calculators are okay
Does that make sense
Yes
Ms Bayer will have this up
Youre going to do the math boxes 2 to 16
If you finish that and youre waiting then you can play expanded ball
Ms Bayer will call groups up to the table to do the displacement
Its clear youre going to do one through seven with your partner at the back table and were going to do number eight with our full class back together
Then my friends at the very end of todays lesson and this Tom this is corrections during the break
Okay there it is
At the very end of todays lesson were going to discuss how does this displacement pitcher help us determine the volume
What is displacement
At the very end Ms Bayer after youve talked about it theres an exit clip for them to explain it
All right
All right so youve been sitting for a while
I would like you to go stand up pair up with someone totally different that you have not worked with today
Not your current thinking partner
Ready
Go
Then theyre just going to do question three
One two three
Yes they did that yesterday
Okay so if they do that then theyre going to get back in there
Okay
Sorry to run
No
I think you have the rest of the questions
Okay my friends your eyes should be back on Ms Bayer
Shes giving you some directions for a brain break
You should be standing with a brand new partner
