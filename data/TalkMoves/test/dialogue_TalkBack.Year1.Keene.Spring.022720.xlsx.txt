However what makes it challenging is it has very different rules than adding and subtracting do
As were learning about multiplication we have to put some of those rules some of those things that I would have you guys repeat to me out of our heads
In order to help us understand multiplication We understand the difference between adding and subtracting and why the rules change
Were going to do a little activity
What I need you to do is I need you to take a handful or so out for each partner group and pass it on
While this is going around I want you to talk with
Theres nobody there
I want you to talk What do you know about multiplication as it is
If I were to say two times three or two times five what does that mean
What are you doing when you multiply go
When you do things like I say if you high five the person next to you turn to the area a lot thats what gives you that negative attention
Its not funny
Its really frustrating because as a teacher what I see is youre defying what Ive asked you to do and making something very simple into a big thing
Thats why you keep getting in trouble
Then dont do it
If you know then dont do it unless youre actually wanting my attention
Then we can figure out a different way to get it
If you dont want my attention then stop it because youre on your way to your behavior report this time
Luis actually Ill put you back because I was talking to you
Piper what does it mean when you multiply
What does multiplication mean
What were you and your partner talking about
We were talking about how to use it
Tell me what were you talking about
Literally What were you talking about
We were talking about how to use strategies for it
Okay first of all my question was not how to use strategies
The question I just asked your friend was telling me the words that you were talking about
I dont want a summary
I want to know
Literally what were the words you were saying to each other
To use it in different parts
What did you say
That the part of the multiplication is that youre multiplying first not to add
Its important that were listening to the question and then asking if we dont understand what the question is addressing because I didnt ask how do you multiply
I asked what is multiplying
Let me give you an example
Can I have a couple of Not the whole thing just a couple
Here is two orange pieces in here
Its three orange pieces
Two plus three equals five
Adding is when you put two groups together
Thats what adding is
What is adding
What is adding
Adding is when you put two groups together
What is adding
What is adding
When you put two groups together
Start with a complete sentence please
Adding is when you put two groups together
My question that you were supposed to be talking about was what is multiplication
I dont want strategies
I dont want examples
I want to literally know when Im multiplying what am I doing with numbers
Bailey
Youre doubling the numbers
The number youre
Okay
Im doubling
What does doubling mean
Can you give me more to that
Doubling is  two times four
You double four
My question and maybe somebody can help Bailey out
I dont want Joey thats your warning youre gonna get a fine if I see you playing
Is what is doubling
Literally if I was somebody who didnt know what the word doubling meant
I do
Technically I understand what you mean Bailey
What Im getting at is Im trying to get you guys to be very specific
What does it mean when we double
Adan Im giving you the same warning
If youre playing with him youre going to get the next
Reese
If you add one more group to the one that youre describing
If you take the exact same original group and just
Exact same helps me
Now is all multiplication doubling
No
No
No
Youre on the right track but you only explained one thing
Reese whats multiplying
Multiplying is instead of adding five plus five plus five six times you do five times six
What youre saying then Reese is you are saying that multiplication is adding the same number over and over again
No
Because you said five plus five plus five six times you would do five times six
When Im multiplying Im adding the same number however many times
Yes
Yes
Well to add to Reeses five plus five plus five instead of just doing five plus five a whole bunch of times youll Itll be easier to do five times seven or five times 13
If I did five times seven how many times would I need to add five
Seven times
Seven
I love that Daria used that discussion stem without me prompting
Adding on to Reese and rephrasing what he said nice job
To rephrase both of them and to have you guys Right up here Lucy is a space for you
Unless you have a no for being recorded
I can be recorded
Okay let me ask him on
Multiplying is repeated addition of the same number
Say it
Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number
Multiplying repeated same numbers
What
Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number
Multiplying is the repeated addition of the same number
Piper whats multiplying
Addition of the same number
Repeated addition
Repeated addition of the same number
All right
In front of you you have some counters
You are going to use those counters to represent on chips the problems on the board
With your partner youre going to figure out what the answer to those problems are
Youre going to be able to explain how did you use the counters to find the answer
Once I found Use my counters to find the answer of onefourth of eight I might write that on my whiteboard so I dont forget because Im going to need to use all my counters again for the next one
The last one is 15
If you dont have 15 counters Ill put them right back here and you can just go grab
Lets take about three Lets take three minutes
Use the counters Pete
I dont want writing
I want counters
Were not using the whiteboard for anything except for recording my answer
Counters are what youre using
You do one write it down
The next one write it down
You have 51 seconds left youre supposed to have done all three and be ready to explain how you used the counters
Thats what you were supposed to be doing right now
I didnt ask you to solve the problems I asked you to use the counters to solve the problems
You figure it out
You persevere
The first step
Find to break these into steps
Onefourth of eight
Onefourth of eight
How many counters do you think you need to look at
Eight okay
What does onefourth mean
What have we already learned about doing a fraction of a whole
Because weve already done this this is a review
We actually already did it with pictures I think
What does it mean one fourth
How many groups do we need to make our eight into
How many equal groups
We need two groups or four groups
Two
No
No
Four groups of two
Five four three two and one
On the table
I have already split the counters into groups
We dont have to deal with counting them
Im going to call a group to come up and explain how they found onefourth of eight
This is actually all review from the first chapter that we did of math
Susannah you and your partner please come on down and share
How did you use the counters to find onefourth of eight
What do I do about the screen
It is on the screen but the counters are on the screen
Thats what I want you to use
Show us what you did
Onefourth of eight
What we did
What we did is
Not what we did
Please dont start with a question word
Please just start with we
Thats the subject of your sentence
We did
Not we did
Say what like when Im sorry to talk about the grammar piece but boys and girls I see this in your writing
I went through that writing yesterday some peoples writing and grammar is a really big issue that interferes with understanding
We dont say we did this
Thats why we learn subject and
Predicate
predicate
Subject is what Whos the sentence about
We
Predicate is whats the action
You could say we moved
We grouped
What is the action that you were doing
Okay
Try again
We times eight by four hence thats the denominator of the fraction
Then we put the multiplication of it then we got 32
Okay
Bree
That group have a seat
My number one thing is the direction said to use the counters
Did you use the counters for that
We did
How
Because my question was how did you use the counters to find the answer
Chris you talk
Susannah does not need to be the only one talking
Shes just the card that I pulled whose group is coming up to talk
Youre welcome to talk as well
We did four groups in
Bree would you like to share your thinking
Thank you ladies have a seat
I think thats wrong
Well he didnt say anything
I think that  32 because it goes eight and then onefourth of it
Split eight into four groups and each group only has two
Okay make your groups a little closer together
We cant see them on the screen
Push them to the right a little bit then well see
There you go
Okay now I think that when I said were working with multiplication that confused people
Thank you very much Bree you may sit down
Because you tried to multiply four times eight
But thats not what the question asked
The question was onefourth of eight
So that means that we have the number eight
Eight cubes
And we needed to make how many groups Carrie
The question was onefourth of eight
Where does the two come from
From here
Four what
Four groups
Okay because the fraction is onefourth
Fractions mean were taking a hole and breaking it into parts
In this case ladies and gentlemen our whole was eight
Thats our whole
Fractions are always part of the whole
Now we are breaking these fractions into four equal groups
Onefourth
whats the numerator class
Four
Im going to ask the question again
Im going to do this to give you time to think
Then Im going to point when Im ready for the answer
I need all eyes and ears listening
Onefourth what is the numerator
One
Right
Youve got to listen to the question
One group out of that is I just moved it out of range
Is how much
Onefourth
Onefourth of eight
Onefourth of eight
That means one out of four equal groups
With your partner the partner wearing the darkest colored shirt paraphrase what I just said
Ill repeat it
After you know the partner whos talking give me a thumbs up
Onefourth of eight means one out of four equal groups
Go
Go
Onefourth of eight means one out of four equal groups
Okay
Whats the job of the denominator when youre looking at a fraction of a problem
A fraction of a problem means one fourth of eight
Whats the denominator tell you as the student trying to figure it out
Think
Brighter shirt share
Go
Go
No thats not a big deal
Yes
Yes
All right
Five four three two one
All right
Other partner whats the job of the numerator
Go
Go
Okay five four three two and one
Heres a group of 10
I want these next two to go by pretty quickly
Please make sure that you are listening and showing that you made some changes or are learning from the first group
Scarlet and group
Please go up there Scarlet and group
I dont know why youre standing there
I dont know why I have to repeat that
Please come and share
Sunny you might have to move out of their way
No put that down
Can we think about what did Shawn and Susannah and Sunny use
What did Bree use
Yes thank you
The question was whats one half of 10
Okay
Here take this and explain
Thank you for my active listening thumbs
I saw one or two
Now that we can hear well see more
the answer was five tenths
The answer is not five tenths
You guys did all of the work right but have an incorrect thinking in the answer
My active listening thumbs this is why theyre so important showed me why
You guys can have a seat again
Guys have a seat
I hear that you guys are realizing some mistakes but since the whole class showed me thumbs up it seems to me thats an important I didnt see your thumb
Thats an important thing to understand
We have one half of 10
Now boys and girls weve been doing this for almost 20 minutes now and Id like to remind you that this is work that weve already done this year
This is work that should have taken five minutes
What it shows me its okay youve forgotten we need to review
Im so glad we are but what that shows me is during math lessons you guys need to be really engaged
During math boxes where this stuff comes up again when you forget you have to advocate for yourself and ask questions
You have to look back in your resources
Can we please cap all markers
Thank you so much
One half of 10
They did all the work right
Is this a fraction or a whole number
Whole number
My answer because Im looking for remember you just told me this two means how many equal groups
They made two equal groups
This one means how many are in one equal group
How many counters are in one equal group boys and girls
Five
Five
One half of 10 means five
Not five tenths because thats a very different answer
These are whole numbers
Five tenths would be one object cut into 10 pieces
Then five tenths would be half of that
Those are two very different answers
This is a whole number because Im looking at two equal groups of 10 how many are in one group
Im not cutting one thing into pieces
Any questions on that
That seemed to be a big piece of confusion
To be honest with you Im not sure it is because I look at a lot of right answers
What I think it is is that you dont really listen when other people talk and when I say active listening thumbs youre just like and you dont have a clue what the person just said
Thats the other thing that shows me
Okay last one
The last one was one fifth of
Okay
Theres 15
Im going to leave my mic right here so whoever comes up can use it
Sorry
Im going to use my card
Luis and partner
Julia can you please put those down
We dont need the whiteboard but what I need is to not waste a minute getting up there to describe the problem
Just go
Can you scooch them a little closer to each other so we can see them
There you go
Thank you
I like that Luis said because Daria can you say why
Why are there five groups of three
How did you know to make five groups of three
I know that I need to make five groups of three because I know five times three equals 15 and five goes to three
What other problem helped you know that they needed five groups
Olivia
You multiply the denominator and the whole number
No because if I multiply the denominator 5 times 15 I would get 75
Lets listen to my question again please
My question was what in that problem told Luis and Daria they needed five equal groups
Cooper
Okay good
The denominator tells us how many groups we need
Good
Okay keep talking
Whats one fifth of 15
One fifth of 15 is three
Because
Because
True and what does the one the numerator tell us
Right so how many are in that one group
How many are in that one group boys and girls
Three
Three okay
All right friends
Please turn in your journal actually before you turn in your journal can you please with your partner discuss any learning from this any refreshing of memories you needed
If you didnt learn anything new just review whats the denominator tell you whats the numerator tell us
Im going to be passing this around for you to put your blocks back into
Can you do it in a really quick manner like take a handful put it in were not doing one at a time
We make three groups of five you take
Five four three two and one
Take about 30 seconds please to review that vocabulary I have at the top of the slide because that vocabulary is telling you the words that I want to hear from you as you are talking today
Okay
One really cool thing Where are all my eyes
I see so many backs of heads
Yes Im back here
Who changed it up
Thank you I appreciate that
One cool thing about these recordings that Ill show you next time is they make a word cloud
What a word cloud is its listening to all the words that I say and you say and then it puts them in a picture and the bigger the word the more option is set
If were using our math vocabulary youll see those words on the word cloud
Tomorrow we can take a look and see how well we did using our math vocabulary
Is it always that thing in ABC  where you can get a lot of words
Maybe I have no clue
I dont know what that is
All right so take 30 seconds right now to read those words that I want to hear today
Youre reading them in your head friends
Head head head head
Thats going to be on my word cloud
Five four three two and one
I said like six times head
Now you know that word is going to be in a word cloud because I had to say it six times
Thank you
Show me thumbs up when youre done reading
The new word that we havent used a lot is a unit fraction
We just worked with unit fractions
Unit fractions are onefifth onehalf one What was the first one we did
Onefourth
Think of a unit fraction in your head turn to your partner
Whoever talked last zip it and the other person talk first and share your unit fractions
Go
Go
Waterfall okay
Theres a picture of two fractions here
Just as we discussed before we started multiplication is repeated addition of the same number
If I have onefifth times three which by the way that means onefifth of three it is onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth
So the answer is threefifths
Okay
How could you use knowing this that onefifth times three equals threefifths and thats onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth
How could you use that to figure out what is threefifths of 20
With your partner Id like you to take a minute or two to try to figure out How can I use this pattern to solve what is threefifths of 20
We just spend some time finding the unit fraction we know that multiplication is repeated addition
threefifths is onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth what is threefifths of 20
Go
Go
Okay so thats not using the pattern
Think about what did we do with the unit fractions and all that 35 40 minutes of work we just did
Think about how the threefifths means onefifth plus onefifth plus onefifth and put that together to find your answer
I dont see you working at all Pete
I dont see you thinking talking doing anything to try to solve this problem
You need to try to solve this problem starting with
Are you done
Then lets keep going
Okay just pass it over here well put it in
I didnt say throw I said pass
Well okay I can see
When I say pass in school its not football
Okay
We hand it
Passing in school is not football
All right Mikara
I dont know
Okay I have an answer
Why is football pass
I dont have an answer
Now moving on to math
If you are not finished talking please continue talking Ill give you about 30 more seconds then Im going to use my cards
Go
Go
By the way Seanna I really liked your thinking
The only thing I have to say is whats our numerator
Five
How many fives do you have there
Im going to call a card that persons going to share their thinking
If you need to go up to the board and write anything the pen is on my desk
If you dont if youre just using words thats fine
Then Im going to call another card to share their thinking
Okay Seanna what was your thinking
How can you use that pattern to solve
Go
Go
Not what I was thinking
Whos the subject
I was thinking
There you go
that I could use just the numerators  to try and
Okay
Bailey
I think you can do on design  put it in bits of three
Okay Cooper
I was thinking that you could do
Okay
All right
First of all I want to say all of these skills are building on each other
The 35 40 minutes we spent finding unit fraction of problems applies to this problem
Im going to bring it back to Seanna
Where did the five come from
Okay
The denominator is five
What did we just learn that the denominator means when we have a fraction of problem
Lets bring it back to our warmup
Lets say we have one onefifth of 20 what does the denominator mean
What does that denominator tell us
We just went over this we spent 35 minutes
Tell your partner
Im using cards
Go
Go
It tells
No it
The denominator tells us that how many groups to put it in
Okay perfect
Im noticing that three fifths of 20 all right that here
What do you notice is different between one fifth of 20 and three fifths of 20
Talk to your neighbor go
Somebody said top number I already know
Okay five four three two and one Carrie whats different
I love your awesome math language and I love your complete sentence
Thank you
What youre telling me then can we pass that to Carrie
What youre telling me then is everything else is the same so that means the same strategy we used for here we could apply for here except one little difference
Thats what were seeing
Because what I was hearing from my friends who shared Daria was we were taking the strategies you just learned throwing them out the window like weve never learned before in our life and making up some other stuff
Im not going to have you do that
Math builds on itself
Sixth grade is going to build on fifth grade
Youre going to use what you learned here this year and add to it
Thats how math works
Okay
If the five is how many equal groups what did we say the one the numerator amounts
Tell your partner Im using my carts go
Red Robin
Yes
Sean what does the numerator tell us
How much youre counting in a group
How much youre counting in a group
Kind of
The numerator tells us how many of the equal groups we need to count
If I have five equal groups of 20 how many is going to be in each group
Four
Four because I know that five times four equals 20
Thats our basic math fact
We shouldnt need to draw a picture of that but if you need to thats fine
One of those groups has four in it
Any questions Piper Julia
What I liked about Ceanna is she had the five thinking wrong however the rest of her thinking is correct
Its the numerator means how many equal groups were going to count how many equal groups are we going to count
Three
Three
If one group has four three groups one two three
Whats the multiplication problem for that
And what does that equal
Three fifths of 20 is 12
The rules state the same
The numerator means how many equal groups
The denominator sorry
The denominator means how many equal groups
The numerator is telling me how many of those groups I need to count so if my numerator is three Im going to count three groups
Any questions so far
Paraphrase what youve learned and were going to turn and practice with page 167 in the journal go
Is this for being off task and not listening when I was teaching
like how many
Quickly
Thats not what I wanted to do
Please fill out numbers one and two right now
Do it independently and then when both you and your partner are done talk about what patterns you notice
Go
Go
In this one
Were on which page
Were on page 100 Oh
167
Im sorry math journal page 167 is with the SEC so I apologize if I misspoke
You didnt really want to
I didnt they just didnt listen
Got you
Is it one that starts
five six but thats a wrong one maybe you just dont want to say it come on
Oh thats page five because thats the wrong lesson
Sorry
I got to fix that
All right
Go ahead and do number one
All right
What should I write class youre going to tell me the whole class
Tell me what goes here
Two five three six
Okay
Thinking about what we just learned talk with your partner whats the pattern between three fifths and this one
Three fifths of 10 is six
Whats the pattern what do you notice
Thinking about what we just learned
Go
Go
I see
You get it
Hey waterfall
Luis can you please share what you noticed
I noticed that on number one that is first and that on question two is six then 236 and same with 35 is 15 and 33 is 9 36 is 18
Well part of the fraction is telling us to multiply by three
Danhew
The numerator is bigger
Youre telling me to paraphrase Luis and Todd if we find the unit fraction of a number in the denominator we can sorry ignore me what I just said
When we find the unit fraction of the number we can multiply that answer by the new numerator to get a fraction of when the numerator is not one
Unit fraction remember means one something
Lets scroll this down its going to take me a second
You guys look at number three in your book while I clear this up
Should we write it or
And go ahead and complete it
All right
You can talk with your partner if you need to
Think about the patterns that we just completed
Bailey what I wanted you to notice is that the numerator is not two so thats four if it was one
Sean you better have something down there and I think Bailey was trying to talk to you
Bailey put eight
Can you tell Sean where that came from
I was thinking six divided by three is two
Six divided by two is three
Waterfall
Ssh
Waterfall
Ssh
Better
Kylie what should I write and how did you figure that out
I think you should write 8 for the out because in the denominator of two thirds the three goes into 12 four times and then the numerator 2 you would multiply 42 and that would equal eight
is this for Bailey
Joey what do you think of what Melanie said
Can you paraphrase Melanie and and tell me what you think our discussion stem I agree disagree or would like to add
I agree with him because he came through with eight
But how did she get it
She divided it by three
Divided what by three
Four and then subtracted whats the she subtracted
She didnt subtract anything friend
Please pay attention when your classmates are talking
Your eyes should be on them
Thats how you pay attention
All right Anna tell me about six
What should I write and why
I think you should write
Can I tell her
Friend numerator end I need you to coach dont tell
Give her maybe a hint on the first step but dont tell and yes you can
Well get the numerator think what you should do with the numerator of the rule and six
What to do with both of them
Im going to tweak what Ali said a little bit I love her coaching
First you need to look at the denominator because notice what I wrote right here
What Melanie explained she first found 13 of 12 first so thats our first step
Whats 13 of 6
Then we can look at our poster and look at our numerator to think What do I need to do with that two
The numerator tells you what Anna
Look at the green
You tell me what the green says read it for Me
How many of equal groups do we have
This is how many are in one equal group
This says I need to figure out how many are in two equal groups
If theres two in one group how many would be in two groups
Two groups would be a third
Two is in one group how many are in two groups
Four
Four this is how many are in one because my numerator is one
The new numerator tells me I need to figure out how many are in two equal groups
Any questions
You have a question sir
Please complete number four independently not with your partner
After you do number four
Can you pick it up for me
Sit Im almost done
I just want to finish writing this last rule
If youre finished compare with your neighbor and see if you agree
Nos you can talk to other people that are actually here
Red Robin
Yoh
Red Robin
Yoh
I also need to see eyes
Sean I need to see your eyes
Thank you so much
Luis
All write I wrote friends can you move
I wrote some step by step steps because I noticed when I said to start some people were just sitting there not able to start
I put these steps here to use as a resource
Well go through 34 of eight as our example
It says to look at the denominator and find how many equal groups
Class when I point at me youre going to tell me how many equal groups are we going to make
Ready
Four
Four so if I do four equal groups and eight is my whole number how many are in one group
Bree how did you get two
Because youre the only one who answered
The rest of your eyes need to be here
Here answering these questions not one person 26 people
How did you get two
How I got two is by I know that four times two is eight and there is four
Yes thank you Luis for your active listening Luis
Another way you could think is eight divided by four equals two either way its the same thing
Tell your partner what did Bree do to figure out two
How many are in one group
Go
Go
Five four three two and one my third step is multiply the amount in one group so thats going to be two times my numerator
Class when I point to you youre going to tell me my numerator
Henry what do you have tell me when I point
We tell you the denominator
No thats why your eyes should be on me when Im talking
Youre going to tell me the numerator
What are you going to tell me Henry
The numerator
When I point whats the numerator
Three
Two times three equals
Six
Show me thumbs up if you have six in that first in and out place thumbs down if you did not
If you did not please use this learning and quickly fix while I go get my pen
Bree can you pass my pen forward
Can you excuse me while I walk through
I dont have my cards on me so Ill take a volunteer
What should I write here Todd
Pardon no major savers today friends
No
Sorry what would I write
You should write 15
Following my steps whats the denominator
Four
How many are in one group if I make four groups
Five
Five times three equals
All right volunteer for this one Bree
Volunteer for this one Ada
Friends if you did not get these numbers now is your time to ask questions
I dont know about whats going on here
Let me see what are these following questions ask
I want you to answer questions number five and six quickly and return to your desk
Again youre doing that independently
If you are at your desk already will you grab a computer for you and your purple partner
Whichever purple partner sits down first gets a computer
You may go to our Math Google Classroom
All of our answers have been full numbers
If I have 12 eggs how many are in one six
If I split it into equal groups of six how many would be in one group
Two
Two yes
12 divided by 6 is 2 or 6 times 2 is 12 every way you look at it always two
I need you to be paying attention too
You were right
Ill send him in just a second
Hes right here with me
I will make sure that I have Luis come get you when we leave for recess
How many eggs did she sell for the bread
She sold 46 not 16
She sold 4 groups of 2
You need to take four times two
All right boys and girls five Shes sold 46 of Boys and girls the last question that you were asked to do Im going to use over here
Thank you
The last question that you were asked to do was to write a multiplication fact
Im going to show you what that multiplication fact is because I didnt actually write that down
46 of was it 20 for the eggs that 12
Yes
46 of twelve is what you were figuring out
When you have fraction of problems you take out the word of you stick in a multiplication sign
Fraction of means youre multiplying
46 times 12 equals what class
Class Bree is not the only person in my class
Im going to stop talking
Ill count my bad that I didnt give you guys some think time
Im going to ask the same question
Im going to give you some time and Im going to point when I want the answer because only hearing one person tells me you guys still dont understand how to do this
Which is not a problem except for the fact that when I stood there and said Who has questions
Nobody asked which means you all understood which isnt true
My question is if I just replace the word of which is what you have in your book with the multiplication symbol its the same thing
14 times 12 equals what
Eight
Yes six equal groups has two in each group two times four equals eight
All right friends
You have 45 seconds to get into Google Classroom with that computer youre sharing with your purple partner
Its always a good idea to take notes
I didnt stop and pause though
Dan
Time is up friends
In Google Classroom it should be the top link or second link in your stream
Theres a link
Youre going to be playing a fraction of game thats not called Pac Man but thats basically what it is
Click the link for me
It needs flash so its going to say Click to do Adobe Flash
Youre going to click that and then click allow and then youll be able to play the game
All eyes on me once you get that part
Once youve got the game I know because youre looking at me
Partner A is going to be closest to a whiteboard
Were going to take turns so one person is going to use the controllers
Youre going to use the spacebar to move forward and the arrow bars to move up down sideways
Partner A is going to say You need to eat a certain course
Lets get out of this
Lets go to Google Classroom
Thank you for your patience
By the way now that this is up here you can play this whenever you want
You could add this as some of like homework if you want or Its a game that practices todays lesson
At the bottom you see 25 of 10
I know that and the ghosts all have numbers on them
I think 10 divided by 5 means theres 2 in each group 2 times 2 is 4
Im going to head down here and eat ghost number 4
Partner A would tell me which ghost to eat so class your partner A tell me which ghost I need to eat now
Ghost two
Three
Really
Where does goes one running because ghost is about to eat me
Where does two come from
Because Ive got seven equal groups and 17 that puts one per group
One times three equals three so my friends who said two which was most of the class just showed me that you dont understand how to do this
Now 14 of 8 we already did that in our morning work is 2
According to the directions here partner A youre going to tell Partner B which group ghost to eat
Partner B is going to then control Pac Man
Once youve eaten that one ghost you switch roles
Its the next persons turn to control and Partner B is now telling them
Make sense
Yes
Were not going to play for 10 minutes
This lesson went way over
Oh I just died
Unfortunately we will still have our party today but we cannot have it now because its lunchtime
Just get out of that game
Because lunch recess is started and were not allowed to go out for lunch recess
This lesson went way long
We will have it this afternoon instead
Well extend our afternoon recess instead just not ideal
The kids will have to stay in for 10 minutes and then come out
Were only going to play this for five minutes instead of 10
You may go
Good job my friend

Since you guys have two computers Gail you return to your seat and just play independently and then Gail can
I passed out to each table a stack of exit slips
Please have the partner with the longer hair put the computer away and work on the exit slip and go to independent reading
There is no transition timer right now so this all needs to happen with zero voices please
