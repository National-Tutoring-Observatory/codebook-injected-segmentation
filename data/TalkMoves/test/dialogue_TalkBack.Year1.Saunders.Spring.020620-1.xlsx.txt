All right ladies and gentlemen
Lets talk about exploration one
Looking at the paired function by comparison Heres actually the answers so you can check your work really quickly
Now well review transformation theres two choices
Were either modifying X or were modifying the entire function
For this first one did we modify X or the entire function
Entire function
What do you think
What did we do
What did we modify
X
We modified X
If we modify the whole function it would look something like this
Our first graph is only modifying X just to get this idea
Now do we just modify X or do we modify the whole function here
We modify the whole function
Right
Because weve put a negative sign in front of the existing function
We modified the whole function
Then this guy
Modifies X
Modify X you think
Yes Well wait
No its the whole function
It is the whole function
It did because theres the x 3 that we see have 2
All right so that modified X
Then this last one did we modify X or the whole function
Which one
This last one
The last one modified the function
Yes
Yes
Because we modified X then we modify the whole function
When I have something like x 3 if Im modifying X Im going to have something with X in it thats cubed
Thats where I see these parentheses happening
If Im modifying the function it looks like that
Now and C should be modifying the function too right
I got lost track
All right
This becomes important because it tells us what were supposed to do
If Im modifying X what happened
Hallway partner explain what happens when you modify X
Here we go modify X
Modifications in X include reflections across the Xaxis and vertical and horizontal transformations
What do you think about that
Just for horizontal translations
I think thats correct
Yes but the vertical trans
A vertical translation modifies the function because its a constant value
We trust Bu low and Bu low we trust
All right so
Youre going to make a new country called Bu low
Now lets do the same type of thing thinking about what is it that were supposed to modify and work with some  You just got two to look at
Go ahead and get started with the two here
All right
Ladies and gentlemen lets talk about these two
As our pairing function translated here and resulted in this did it modify X or did it modify the whole thing
It modified the whole thing
Right
Were seeing the modification in X here and were seeing the modification to the whole function there
Duplicates so these have both things going on
All right
Now the toolkit is going to begin with the piece of paper that you have there
If you would go ahead and pull out your toolkit
All right so lets update the tracker
Update your table of contents
Do I have a table
All right on the lefthand side we have the keynotes with regards to solving polynomials
The overall process factor use the zero product property and then you can graph them
The only thing thats really new from 35 was the rational root theorem
This is as its expressed mathematically the rational root theorem
Then for this example down here I basically prompted you all the way through it
While the big ideas are the factor use the zero product property and then graph I broke it down more thoroughly as you go through the example
Include the props and then whatever space you need to actually do them
Dont write all these props out until you just do the first steps see how much space you need and so on
Note though that I did write up here a couple of other ideas
First we need to have our equations that equal to zero
All of the factoring stuff that you learned in Math II is all fair game including the quadratic formula
If you dont remember what the quadratic formula is then refresh your memory on that
In 34 we had all kinds of factoring so some major types
You can expect to see a lot of factoring on the test
Yes
Yes
Theres a cubic formula right
There is yes
Is it worth learning
Yes it would be worth learning
What the freak is that
Weve already had it in 34
It would both the sum and the difference so theres two formulas when it comes to cubes
Then its factored
Remember when its squared only the difference of squares can be factored
The sum of squares cant be factored so there are three patterns along those lines the sums and the differences
Can you solve Is there a way to solve the sum of two cubes
Yes
Yes
Using rational roots
Yes
Yes
This will work for everything
Not too shabby
Since were setting this ratio if my leading coefficient is 1 its fairly simple
Fairly straightforward
If my leading coefficient is something other than 1 then Im going to really increase the number of options for what the factors could be
Our first example is with a 1
It simplifies the number of fractions of possible factors
Then the second example well have something other than 1 for the leading coefficient and I just havent picked that one yet
The only thing right now we have for this toolkit is just what I gave you
Now it might be interesting to note on here as a way of studying and looking for patterns is to whether or not were modifying X or were modifying the whole function
For example when I look at this am I modifying X or the whole function
Youre modifying X
Im modifying X
Thats the whole function
Thats how the whole function is going to look like
I just copied that function and Im adding something to it
What happens here
Am I modifying X or am I modifying the whole function
Modifying X
Just X
Just X
Then this one is showing that I modified
The whole function
The whole function so whatever that function is its all of it
Youre modifying the whole thing
Here am I modifying X or the whole function
Just X
Just X
Here Im modifying the whole function
You notice we have cases where were adding and subtracting
Were changing signs and were multiplying
In both cases its a different effect if were doing it to just X which I see as I go down here
Or if Im doing it to the whole function as I see in those
It might not be a bad idea to go through and maybe highlight the ones and just make a note
Im modifying just X in that case
I like the others
Im modifying the whole function
Probably before the end of the day Ill have the examples to do but its just going to be this and a couple of examples
All right
The next thing to turn your attention to is If you need glue sticks Ill pull those down too if you want to go ahead and get them glued in
Otherwise lets move on to the extra practice in the journal so page 93
Is the transformations of polynomial functions the seventh toolkit
Its the sixth
The sixth set is solving polynomial
Let me doublecheck
Yes it should be the sixth one
It should be the next one
Maybe I have an extra
Do you have the thing fold up that I can look at
The what
Never mind
Its two days old dont take it
Its been in my backpack
Itd be a vertical translation of nine units down
How do we figure that out
Right
What would we have to know
Typically what are things that wed graph for here
Whats our strategy
If I take a function and I changed everything has that affected X or Y
What we want to do is we want to be able to distinguish  Changing the whole thing
Its clearly one of the things which obviously
Yes in this case
Lets go as far as we can
I have a theory X3 and X7 which is a septic they are undiscernible on a graph except  does it become more discernible when you add like 4x to it
bonce off the Xaxis what makes it appear like that
X is a  on its own is just a flatter parabola at the bottom
Correct
When you do X2 and x4 that flatness appears so what makes the balance actually
You are being very disruptive
I agree
Lets keep going on this
Lets raise our question stem from them
In some ways its easier because we should be familiar with these ideas
Yes and it applies the same no matter the
I think the challenge in this test
How does that work though
Not only for synthetic division but how does that tell us that its going to be
If we find out that 1 has a 0 remainder then we know that x is the factor and what I have down here from my synthetic division tells me what if you started with the  what the cubic is
What the cubic could look like
You can look at the cubic and go maybe thats something that you would know how to factor
Maybe you could recognise that its a part of no
We have to have a 0 remainder
Thats the key that tells us that thats an actual factor
Ladies and gentlemen the answers for 37 are up here
Youre free to check what youve already got
G has modified X and then modified the function
How are you just modify X
That should start with that step
How would rewrite this if all was doing is modifying X like that
Where would you put the negative
We write this with just that one translation
What would you do
Did the second bell ring
Yes
All right
Were just going to take a short break until five after
Then were going to come back for a quiz
It will be a team quiz and you can use your toolkit and your textbook
I feel like expandable
All right ladies and gentlemen lets turn into teams
This is going to be no calculators but you
Lets put the journals away and you can pick your toolkits and textbooks
You can use textbooks but no calculator
Phones should be off and off of you
Calculators need to be put away
With these  is that what it should look like
Thats not your answer
They model up
Did you get the xintercept
It says solve
In other words the values of the variables could make that
I was just comparing it to his because he got a perfect square  Sorry that got just really anxious
You do not enter the standard form you wont see a square root but you could have a factor that has a square root
For this what should I do here
X
You got to think of all four factors together
When you look at  Does it look like that
The only strategies we have listed right here
These four and that one
It got to be one of those five strategies
If it doesnt then you got to use this
So theres three terms
Its either this or that
You didnt write W2
Look at the square
Considering how Mrs Saunders may have constructed the test I am taking a very wild estimated guess that its 1
For the first one
The last one is going to be the hardest one because its going to have decimals
It is good its time to learn now
Pull out the example
Theres only three examples in 35 so all the problems are those examples
Yes
Yes
When you have three terms of these theres only one that has got three terms
After we are done with the quiz Ill show you how to do what you are asking about
Its not quite straightforward
All right ladies and gentlemen
All right so the 35 homework thats what youre doing right now basically is like the 35 homework
This is all 35 content
Now of course 35 you cant do without factoring
Its kind of a combination of 34 and 35
Obviously how long have we spent on this now so far
Think about whats next
Whens our test
Wednesday
Wednesday a shorter period
You have to be able to do these kinds of things in about a halfhour
In other words youve got to get to the point where you could take this packet and do it in about a halfhour or so
Why is it on Wednesday and not Tuesday
Maybe
Thats just the way the schedule worked out
No we got Wednesday
Thats why Im trying to get you to see
Youve got to know how to do this right away
Now what Id like to do we only have about five minutes left so put all of the quizzes together make sure youre turning them in as a team
Then Ill probably give you time tomorrow
Go ahead and turn them in and then you can leave the books on the desks
All right Ill turn mine in
If theres a specific type of problem you want to talk about before you leave thats why Im giving us a few minutes if you want any particular questions about any of the examples
If you would go ahead and turn off the microphones for me and just leave them where they are
