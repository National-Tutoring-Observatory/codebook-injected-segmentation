All right guys
Lets regroup
Let me help you
You ready
Yes
How many of you did this first pink problem
Eli tell me what you got for 20 x 3
I have 60
Excellent
How many of you did this problem here
Brooklyn what did you get
20
Excellent
How about this one right here Sean
Whats 30 x 5
150
You got it
How about this green one Julian
140
Excellent
50 x 5 Kaylee
250
250
80 x 8 Nathan
640
640
Check the zeros on this one
400 x 6 Lennox
240000
Good job
700 x 5 Charles
350
How many zeros do you have
Two
Two so
350000
Good job
Good revision 3500
900 x 8 Amy
720000
All right so if principals going to buy us some snacksized pretzels and there are 540 bags in 9 cartons
Give me your number model please or your equation that you wrote
Jonathan what did you write
I did 540
Can you just give me the equation that you wrote
I did 540   9 and I got 60
Oh hold on just a second
If we read our directions carefully we had to write a letter for the unknown
What letter would you like
X
One way to write that was 540   9
Did you use that division symbol
Yes
Did you
Okay
Did anyone else do 540   9 with a different symbol
Eli what symbol did you use
Oh I used the slash mark
You used the slash mark
5409 and what letter would you like
O
You need to be careful with O because sometimes it looks like a zero
Do you like that little house symbol
Does anyone know how to write it out with the little house symbol
Oh I love this
So many hands are going high
Ms Eva where do you write the 540
Do you put it outside the house or inside the house
Outside
Hmm
Its inside
Its basically telling you if this is the whole thing and we want to divide it into nine equal parts
Where do you write your answer
Anyone else
Top
On the top
Our answer would be up here and Eva Im going to give it a seat
Thats where we would write our answer once we figure it out
That looks really funny
Let me erase that
That was one way to show our equation
Who did an equation differently
Mike
What I did instead of multiplication
Tell me your equation
I did a 9540
You got it
Does that work as well
Why does that work
Because its still showing you what you need to figure out how many bags are there in a carton
Its just demonstrating it in a different way
We know that this letter right here is going to tell us how many bags are in the carton
This is the cartons and this is how many total bags there are
We just know were missing this piece and thats what we need to find out
Did anyone do it in a different way
What if I wanted to start with 540 equals what would I do for the rest of my equation
Hailey
I would do I think
Look at this one and then tell me what would I write after the equal sign
Nine
Would I multiply or divide
Divide
Im dividing something to equal 540
Look carefully at this one
You would multiply
I would multiply nine times Im going to use a little i for Hailey
Is it okay to put the answer first then the equal sign and then do the multiplication
Yes
You guys do that all the time in your math class didnt you
Okay so either way you know that 540 is a big number of things
We need to divide into nine equal groups
Were just trying to figure out how many are in each of those nine groups
For the first few days were going to do equal shares
Eventually were going to get into division problems where youll have some leftovers that dont actually fit into a group to make equal shares
Those are called remainders but were going to focus really closely on all the different ways to equally share
You may clear your whiteboard
Open your math journal
You should be on page 191
What are these things
triangles
Are we doing fractions right now
Thats a triangle
Triangles
How many of you used these in second grade or third grade
Okay basically theyre flashcards have facts on but theyre triangles because there are two numbers that multiply together to give you a product or you can start with the big number and know that these two numbers were multiplied together to get to that big number
Theyre basically just showing you what would be a fact triangle for an extended fact
Do we know division to clear up to 240
No
But do we know basic facts
Oh dont erase
Dont erase
Why are you erasing
Do we know factor pairs for 24 when one of the factors is 8
Yes
Okay
If I know factor pairs for 24 which you do because you did a great job on your posters problem what is the other factor in the pair of factors for 8 and Ms Remy
30
Under this dudes thumb
If it were just 24 we would see a 3 but is it 24
No
No so how do I know which one to put the zero on
Thats a tricky question
Julian how do I know which one to put the zero on
You put the zero on the three because the eight does not have a zero
If you think of your equal sign as a balancing scale you want to remember that you want equal number of zeros on each side of the scale to balance it out
240 equals 8 times something
Well heres our balancing scale
How many zero zero over here
One only
I dont have a zero there so in my other factor I need to include that zero
Christopher when you see this did you see how I did that on your homework
I put dots under your zeros
Okay
Our basic fact was 24 divided 8 equal groups of 3
In your brain I want you to think 8 times what equals 24
You know that
You dont have to do extra thinking there
Well 8 x 3 is 24 so if there is a 0 here because at every balancing scale we also need a 0 here
Tell me what basic fact I should be thinking of with this second facts triangle Asher
You should be
Whats going on in your brain
Well you should be thinking about what times 4 equals 28
Yes thats my basic fact thought and what is it
Six
Seven
Eight
No
Yes its eight
Seven
I mean seven not eight
Yes
Okay
Not six
Some of you said six
Excuse me
4 x 7 is 28 but do we have 28
No
No we have 28 10s or 280
If this is our balancing scale and we add a zero what do we need to add zero to
The four or the seven
The seven
The 7 so really that would be 70
We would do 280
If you want to do the slash sign you can
If you want to do the little division They do the slash sign on there
If you want to do this you can
They mean the same thing
Any questions on what to think of before you answer
How many of you already just know your facts so well that division is like Oh I got it
Guess what
Those of you with your hands up are the ones that are passing your multiplication times test very close to 50 or 50
Hey friends that has your hands up is it true that the more you know your fact the easier math is becoming
Yes
I keep trying to tell you all
Lets see
You have three four five six
Please pay attention to how many zeros
Sometimes the zeros are already in the problem so pay attention to those things
You have three four five six
Then number seven asks you to explain what strategy did you use to solve number five
Youre going to have to put into words what you were thinking to help you answer number five
Then you just have math classes
How many of you finished math classes earlier today
Great so you can work on your homework if youd like or the game was Did anyone see what the game was
It was something about Divide and Conquer
Divide and Conquer
Divide and Conquer
Okay
Charles while youre up would you please get me an SRB so we can see what Divide and Conquer is
Its SRB page 254
Its a lot like Beat the Calculator
Thats when you guys are guessing numbers in certain places and adding on and Did you get it
All right Divide and Conquer
You need a set of Divide and Conquer cards or fact triangle
Im sure theyre in the drawer over there or in the files over there
You need a calculator
It says practicing extended division facts
Step one Ms Maya can you read that from where you are
One player is the caller one is the calculator and one is the brain
How many people are in your group
Three
We dont get to do that very often
All right so can we please have three people be our role model
One two three
Maya Brooklyn Maddie
What would be a pretty normal group anyway wouldnt it
Yes
You girls come on up here
Maddie youre the caller
Hi caller
Maya youre the calculator and youre the brain
Youre a gray gooey
Brain
brain
Okay caller youre going to shuffle
Model shuffling
Youre going to place him face down in front of you guys
No just the pile
Caller youre going draw a facts triangle from the pile and extend the fact on the triangle by attaching one of the following either a zero to the dividend Uhoh we dont know what that means
Who can I have
Ms Hailey would you do me a big favor
Would you go to that board and write the word dividend on it
Ill help you spell it
Write it up higher a little bit higher
DIVIDEND dend END end
Okay so we need to figure out what that is or Ms Maddie youll put a zero on the dividend and a zero on the divisor
Dont leave yet
Write this word underneath it divisor DIVISOR
Thank you
Or youll put two zeros on the dividend
We dont know what that means until we define what those words are
Anyone have any idea of what those words are
Jeremiah you know what a divisor and a dividend is
I think dividend means the number that like you have 150 the number you divide it by
You divide it by 8
Im going to write a problem up here Jeremiah and have you label for me
We had done 240   8  x
Which one the 240 the 8 or the equals
The eight
You are actually incorrect
This is the divisor
This is the dividend whats being divided
Anyone know what the answer to a division problem is called
An answer to an adding problem is a sum
The answer to a subtraction problem is a difference
The answer to a multiplication problem is a product
Sum
No because thats for Starts with a QU
A question
Dont say it
Dont say it
Everyone on the count of three
Oh one two three
Quotient
Quotient
Everybody say quotient
That is the answer to a division problem
A dividend is the number youre dividing up the divisor is what youre dividing it by
Quotient is the answer
A divisor and a quotient are factor pairs
Divisor and quotient are factor pairs
Ill leave that up there so now the game will make sense
Okay
Oops Ive covered it up
Now we know you get to add a zero to the dividend the answer or a zero to the dividend and one to the divisor or two zeros to the dividend
You need to make a choice
Then the caller get to read the problem aloud and ask for the quotient
Lets say our card had 24 and eight and three
Maddie decided we were just going to add a zero to the dividend
Our caller is going to read the problem exactly as it is
Okay 240   8 is
Is what
Thats your way of asking for the quotient
Calculator youre going to use a calculator to solve the problem but the brain is going to do it without the calculator and well see whos faster
Remember Beat the Calculator you do with multiplication
Yes
Its the same thing but youre doing it with division
Every five turn you trade jobs
Thats a fun one to do when youre done with your fact triangle
My battery is dead
Thats all right
It can probably hear me on yours All right any questions on what you need to do
Thank you volunteers
Two people have questions so make sure youre listening
Eli
Do we do with partners
On your fat triangle
Yes
No
This isnt easy
Youre kidding
Im not kidding in fact you have four problems to do
homework to
Fish I do want you to take time to play the game so we have half an hour
Youve 30 minutes to do those problems and do your homework
Your homeworks in the tray
Youre welcome to do that but then I do want you to take time
Ill get the quotient or Beat the Whatever its called
