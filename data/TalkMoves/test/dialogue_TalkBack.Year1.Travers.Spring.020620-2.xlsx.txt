Okay
For the second one what is it
I got 09
Then the other one I got  and then the other one I got
All right
Fourth graders remember Ms Traverss signal high five
Thank you so much
Hands down
Were there any questions or wonderings about the mental math
Elijah
We got every single one the same
Excellent
besides the second green one
Okay
The second green one Elijah and was your partner Ava
Yes
Okay
Would you ask your classmates if theres someone that could help us with our understanding of this
If youre looking at your white board the threes and the tenths place right now and so that would make it 30
If you move it over to the next one that would make it 300s
You guys have a great tool on your name tag
You can look at where the decimal is on your name tag and the place just to the right is the 10s
The place just to the right of that is the 100s
You would have 03
Thanks for asking because we know remember what we said the other day
What do good math students do
Ask questions revise their thinking
Awesome job
Okay
Was there another question for mental math William
Im not very sure  every time you do a hundred point zero
Are you looking at this one right here
For 2300s
Ask your classmate what should she have for 2300s
Have a classmate help you
023 or zero and twentythree hundredths
So the three would be in the hundredths place
Okay
All right
My friends so right now you may erase your whiteboard
I would like for you to please come to the carpet
You are going to face the easel and you dont need to bring anything
Okay
This is the easel
Yes
If you have a microphone if I asked you to bring the recorder please bring it
All right
Thank you for coming so quickly and showing me youre ready
So everybodys sitting in place where they can see the easel
Can you see it over there Suzanna
Yes
Okay
All right
So friends were going to talk about what our goals are today in our lesson
Please read this with me
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Solve multistep multiplication number stories
Its almost like a tongue twister isnt it
What I want us to talk about is what does this mean Solve multistep multiplication number stories
You can put your hands down
What I want you to do is high five a partner so I know who youre talking with here at the carpet
Show me that you have a partner to talk with at the carpet
Abby you might just turn around
Henrys right there
I love how Ethan came up and he just
I know
What a great classmate
Perfect
Okay
When it says Solve multistep multiplication number stories are we Focus on this word right now multistep
What do you think that means
Talk with your partner
High five
High five
Jake what did you guys talk about
We thought it was just like a multiplestep problem
What does that mean multiplestep problem
Theres many steps in one problem
Thats that word
My friends I want you to know that these problems today have two or more steps
When youre working on these problems if you just solve one step youre only part of the way there
Okay
So you have two or more steps
Multiplication whats another word for multiplication
Say it
What do you do when you multiply
Times
Okay
We know well be multiplying and number stories
How are we feeling about the learning target today
Cool
Good
Cool
All right
Now heres my next question
How are we going to know that we have it today
Well there are three things
Show me number three
There are three things you have to have today to know that youve answered these correctly
Keep up number one and read with me
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Answer in a single number model using parenthesis
Another Whoa
What does that mean
Talk to that shoulder partner again
Go
Go
So it looks like  five
Five times seven times five so that you have
Three
Two
One
High five
Boy I am telling you there are some kids in here that are on it
Show me your high five
Bodies turn facing Ms Travers
Excellent
Wyatt what do you think this means
I said to my partner that it means that theres one number model using parenthesis
One number model
What does that mean
One number
sentence
Equation
With parenthesis its like youre using parenthesis to do if it was five times five plus two times five what you would do is
Wyatt Im going to take what you just said and do an example up here
Say that again
Five
Times five plus two times five
That is what were working on today
Youre going to have a number story and you will represent the number model with two parts
Therell be multiple parts
There might even be three parts and then therell be parenthesis because you always do the multiplication parts first
Then you would have an equal and youre going to have a letter
The letter represents the unknown like dollars or money or inches
Okay
William
Could we also write down the letter that begins if you know the answer
Yes
Well what I usually do it doesnt really matter what letter you use but what I would do is I would say Well I know theyre talking about money
So I might use the letter M or D for dollars or C for cost or C for cat
Second bullet show me number two on your fingers
Second thing we have to have on each of our number stories today
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Estimate
Estimate each
Tell your same partner what does that mean
Telling your partner what estimate
Three
Two
One
High five
You guys are so fast at those high fives
Awesome job
Elijah tell us about this second bullet
Estimate is an educated guess
I love that saying educated guess
When you say educated what do you use to make that educated guess
Like you use  to make that guess like you take the stuff from the problem and do maybe use it and round it or something
I love that word
You might use rounding or you might take parts of the problem
Away
away so that you can just look at parts and say Does my answer make sense when I multiply those two numbers
Youd like to make the problem easier and then youll see if your answer that you got is Most of the time in math process we have to see if our answer is  to our estimate
If we got 3700 for our estimate it has to be somewhere near that number
Lets say you have 3782
You might round that up to 4000 because 4000 is an easier number to work with
Thanks for that great example
Okay
Number three
Show me your number three
This is the third thing we have to have
Ready
Ready
Read it
Go
Go
Answer with units
Okay
You have 10 seconds with your partner
What does that mean
Go
Go
Three
Two
One
High five
Are we able  Leo
Answer with units mean its like when you get your answer for your problem you want to
The question really is what is it
Right
Right
What are we talking about
Were talking about money balloons miles inches
You will have a word like dollars or whats another one William
Inches
Inches centimeters
You need to have that unit
Unit  is a keyword
Awesome
Okay
Heres your job
You are going to walk back to your desks but on the way back to your desks I want you to think to yourself What are the three parts to all of my answers today
Were going to say single number model with
Parentheses
Parentheses
We need an
Estimate
And we need
Units
Okay
On your way back tell yourself What are the three parts we need in our answer today
Ready
Ready
Back to your seats
Go
Go
Tell yourself What are the three parts for our success criteria today
you have  ready for me
Boy Im a lucky teacher today
I can return mine
Okay
All right
Now that youre back at your seats I would like for you to stand up and face the screen
stand up  your chair
Face the screen
You dont need anything right now
Were going to read the math message together
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Look at the information in the top table on Math Journal Page 188
Be sure to know that the cost per hour is for each performer in the group
How much more would it cost to hire the tap dancers and the jugglers
Okay
You can sit back down
I want you to picture something in your head
Point to your head
Close your eyes
Picture a carnival
Picture the Silver Creek carnival
Picture a carnival youve been to somewhere else
Picture any carnival
Today all of your math problems are about a carnival
Okay
Were going to be figuring out the costs at a carnival
Were going to be figuring out things like Whats more expensive the popcorn or the
I dont know
Ice cream
or should we hire tap dancers or jugglers
These are real problems that somebody like our PTOs of Silver Creek might have to think of again problems like this when they set up a carnival
Okay
Eyes back open
Everybody got a carnival in their head
What do you picture Julian
I dont know
You dont know
What do you picture in a carnival
Name one thing
A Ferris wheel
A Ferris wheel
What do you picture Jake
Roller coaster
A roller coaster
What do you picture Natalie
A unicycle
A unicycle
What do you picture Anna
Lions
There we go
Okay
So we have different pictures in our heads but thats what were using today
Ready
Ready
Take out your journal Page 188 please
You know leave your whiteboards out because if were going to do this we might need a place to write down some thinking from our math
One hundred eightyeight
Oh my gosh
Look at how many kids are showing us their readiness Ms Parker
Pencils in their hands Page 188 open
All right friends
We have two students Ian and  and they are planning their elementary schools carnival
Okay
Or theyre calling it a fair
This is the information that theyve researched and they gathered
We are going to help these students make the decisions about their carnival
Okay
What were looking at Our math message was
The math message
Lets go back to that
Thank you Vanna White
Yes
You might probably dont know what Vanna White
Means do you
No
Mr Powell  do you
Yes
Have you ever seen a game show on TV
Yes
Where theres one person thats showing the things and doing the things like this
Thats Ms Parker for me today
Okay
So were looking at page 188
Now which two were looking at what
Tap dancers
Tap dancers and
Jugglers
Okay
So lets go back to our journal tap dancers and jugglers and were trying to figure out how much more
Okay
Heres jugglers
My friends this is
Lets talk about this
What does all this mean
In the juggling group how many people are there juggling
Three
I want to hear all of your voices
How many jugglers are there
Three
Okay
How many hours do the jugglers perform
Two
How much money does it cost for each performer
30 an hour
Lets think about that
30 an hour for three people
Wouldnt it be 30 for two hours
Yes but for how many people
Three people two hours 30 for each one of those people per hour
This is what we have to figure out
Okay
Now here we go
Tap dancers how many performers for the tap dancing
Six
I didnt hear you
Six
How many hours
Two
How much money do the tap dancers make per hour
33 per hour
Okay
I dont want you to have any pencils or any markers in your hands
Put them down
All I want you to do right now is talk to your shoulder partner what is this problem asking
Thats this question right here
What is this problem asking
What is this problem asking
Go
Go
Can you put the math message back up
Okay
Ladies and gentlemen
High five
That was fast
Thank you
Just waiting for a couple of kids
Great conversations
Ms Parker and I we would like to hear from a couple of you and then were going to actually model for you
Were going to show you how to talk through each of the steps so that then you can have the rest of the time to talk about steps and you will have a different thinking partner today in a little while
Okay
Right now what are you thinking
What is this problem asking
What is this problem asking
Is anyone willing to share
Its asking how much more money is it for the tap dancer
How much more money
If we think back to our success criteria my friends look back up here
We need to come up with what is our number model that shows this problem
We need to estimate our answer solve our answer and then our answer need to have a unit
What units do we think it will be
Money
Dollars
Dollars
Dollars
Okay
Would you please leave everything where you are
Were going to have you turn and actually come to the carpet and face the screen
Okay
Look at these friends
Ladies and gentlemen Ms Parker is my thinking partner today
Right away when I get to my new thinking partner remember the very first thing I do
Good morning Ms Parker
Good morning
How are you
Im great
How are you
Good
Hows your day going so far
Its been really good
Good
We should get to work
Yes
We should get to work
Ms Parker we have four steps in our problemsolving today
We have four steps in all of our problems today
The first one is were always going to say What is the problem asking
Then what are the steps we need to take
Does our answer make sense
Does our answer make sense
We need to estimate
Did we have units
Now we have As and Bs and our thinking partners are As and Bs also
Today can you please for the first time be Partner A and Ill be Partner B
Yes
Okay
That means if youre Partner A youre asking the questions
If Im Partner B that means Im giving you my thinking
You can add on if we need to
Perfect
Okay
Okay
Im going to sit here
When we do this at our desks we will both have our journals out
Perfect
Ms Parker were just going to look up here
Lets see
So were looking at tap dancers and jugglers
Right
Right
Yes and you can use  use this
Do you want me to
How much more would it cost to hire the tap dancers than the jugglers
Ask me my questions
Ms Travers step one
What is this problem asking you
What is this problem asking
What is this problem asking
This problem is asking how much money its going to cost how much more the tap dancers will cost or how much more the jugglers
Maybe Im confused
Lets look back at our problem Ms Travers
How much more the tap dancers
Yes how much more it would cost to hire the tap dancers than the jugglers
How much more are the tap dancers
Okay
Thank you
Its always good to clarify
Then Ms Travers it wants to know our next step
What are the steps to solve the problem
Our steps the first thing we need to figure out is Im going to start with tap dancers how much it will cost for the tap dancers
Then how much it will cost for the jugglers
Then I will make that single number model putting both of those multiplications together but wait a second
Am I adding how much more
That tells me were not adding
Im going to be subtracting
Yes
That word How much more is always a keyword
Remember
So we know
I really appreciate those of you that are working so hard to be careful listeners right now and youre watching how Ms Parker and I are modeling
Remember that would mean your hands are on your lap
Youre sitting
Your eyes are on us
Your eyes are on the screen or on us
Okay
Tap dancers
Ready
Ready
Six performers how long friends
Two hours
How much money
33 per hour
I know Im going to do multiplication
So my friends Im going to start with six performers times two hours times 33
Yes because remember Ms Travers it said on here One of our things says Be sure to know that the cost per hour is for each performer in the group
Thats kind of the key dont you think
Absolutely
Each performer because we have six We might even need some labels on this
We have six performers
Its for two hours and this is how many dollars per performer
Ms Travers doesnt this mean right here in the book the slash right here means per hour
Per hour 33 for every hour
Yes
We know from that label too
Right
Right
Okay
Thank you so much
Now Ms Parker can you please help me
We just did
Those are the tap dancers
Tap dancers
Okay
Now I need my money for the jugglers
Ready
Ready
Jugglers are
Friends I need your help
How many performers
Three
How many hours
Two
How much money
Thirty per hour
Thirty per hour
Okay
That looks like this
Three times two times what
3000
Wow
Equals
Remember we need that letter
The D represents what
Dollars
The dollar
Dollars in units
Okay
So check my success criteria so far fourth graders
So far do I have a single that means one number model with parenthesis
Yes
Have I estimated yet
No
No
Ms Travers step three says does the answer make sense
Okay
Im going to solve first and then estimate
Ready
Ready
If you did 6  2 is 12 and 12  33 Whoops
Then Im going to need to do 3  2 is 6 and 6  30
Right
Right
So far are you agreeing with me
Yes
What do you guys think
Yes
So far
Why does
Oh okay
I just heard subtract or add
What do you guys Fourth graders what do we think
Subtract
How do you know
Because thats how much more
The tap dancers 12  33 Im going to use
Bow tie
What multiplication strategy do I know
Bow tie
Okay
Bow tie
Youd call partial products both sides
Im going to start on the left
I have 30  10
Thirty times 10 is
Three thousand
Thirty times time
Three hundred
Wait 33 times
Right
Right
Yes
Yes
That was this
Now I need 30  2 which is
Fiftysix
Sixty and 10  3 which is
Thirty
Three times two is
Six
Six
So far the tap dancers cost
Three hundred ninetysix
39600
Okay
Minus Ms Parker what do I need to figure out now
We need to figure out the cost of the jugglers
The jugglers
Yes
So 6  30
I dont need partial products for that
I know 6  3 is what
Eighteen
Eighteen and I can attach the zero and get
One hundred eighty
One hundred eighty equals D for dollars
Now 396  180 is
Two hundred sixteen
You didnt think
You dont think
Wait
Hold on because
What do you think
You know what were showing you right now
Were showing you our thinking so that then you can go do your own thinking
Ms Parker if I think about this Im just going to use my estimate with this problem down here
I know 396 is close to 400 and I know 180 is close to 200
So  since youre over there what two words when were estimating we use what
Round to each numbers
Round to get easy numbers so 400  200 is
Two hundred
Two hundred
So my estimate is
So is 216 a reasonable answer
Yes
Her last question says What units does it use
Dollars
Dollars
Dollars
Dollars
Dollars
Right
Right
Dollars
Dollars
Dollars
I would make sure that in my journal I have my number model I have my estimate and then my answer with my unit
My friends guess what your job is now
To go do the problem
Youre going to do number one with your new thinking partner and after you stand up youre going to take a walk back over and check out your new thinking partner
Okay
Freeze
Youre going to go find your new thinking partner
Do you remember when Ms Parker and I greeted each other this morning
All I want you to do right now Freeze
Freeze is get your math journal get your pencil and go greet your new thinking partner
Go
Go
Its technically not
Go find your thinking partner
Im with Caleb again
Hello
Go find your thinking partner
Grab your journal
Grab your pencil
Three
Two
One
High five
Lets try it again
Ready
Ready
Hands down
Three
Two
One
High five
When you high five that voice should be off
Now follow with your eyes
Follow up here
For this round these are our As and these are our Bs
These are our As these are our Bs
If you are an A you are asking the questions like Ms Parker did
If you are a B you are answering like I did but both partners are writing
Okay
Just for number one then were going to come back to the carpet and check
Okay
Here are your steps
Whats the problem asking
What are our steps
Does our answer make sense
Does our answer make sense
What unit do we use
Okay
five minutes
Well see
Yes
Ill check in with you in five minutes
Okay
Would you wave at me right now if youre Partner A
Youre asking the questions
Wave at me right now if youre Partner B
Okay
Youre thinking out loud and Partner A is responding
Okay
Wave at me right now if youre writing today
That should be both of you
Youre both doing the writing
Come in
Ready
Ready
Go
Go
Did you answer me
Single number sentence
All right
Okay
and youre going to  on me too
partner during the writing
Okay so what are the
Two is that what comes first
Wait
No
Lets start  and look at Ms Travers
Im going to put Ms Travers
Friends commercial break
Theres no commercial now
We dont even have any commercials anymore
How much more I just want you to take a minute and look at the screen because we have our example problem and that might help you with your steps
Okay
We have our parentheses two times for two parts of the problem and then the labels and then showing what you solved
Okay
Continue
Well meet back at the carpet in two minutes
I really love how you  that youre working on
What do you need
Are you A
No its fine
My friends
Regular multiple
Tell me where you are now
Single number model
Ryan have you finished
What number model
Fourth graders please freeze
Would you all please show me on your fingers how many minutes just for this problem number one would be helpful for you and your partner to have a success number model estimate answer with units
Im thinking three two or one minute
Show me now
10
Two minutes
Okay we will meet in the carpet in two minutes with what you have okay
Just what you its okay with what you have
Go
Go
Pampara pam pam
Pam pam
I am seeing the most amazing math thinking
Id like you to bring your journal and your pencil to the carpet and face the screen
Go
Go
All right nice children Im going to have some students be the showers right now and Im going to just do some talking and showing upfront
Ms Travers I saw so many people just persevering and talking through problems because these were hard right
You know what I want to tell you guys theres something called a math practice standard
That means what we want all fourth graders to be able to do and one of those is called persevere through the problem and I know a lot of you did that today
Ive asked a couple of students to show their number models
Im going to wait until its quiet
While youre at the carpet you are welcomed to add on to what you have but I want you to still be focused on this problem
Do not move onto the next problem because you might hear some really great thinking from your classmates
Remember we talked about how good math students revise their thinking
Get your pencil ready to revise your math thinking if you need to or to add to it okay
All right would you two start for us please
First we did 40 x 16  8 x 3 x 22   because its a unit
I like how you used that word unit
Me too
Then I did 12 x 16 and  then I got 192 and then on my side corner I did 24 x 22  528
Then after I did that I did 528  192 because those are my two answers and that equals 336
Because we were finding the difference and so you know you needed to subtract the two amounts
The difference in the amount is 336 what
Dollars
Dollars thank you
They did a really good job too because when I went over there at one of the steps they both had a different answer and so going back through and figuring out Skylar was working at his to see where they had a different answer and it just had to do with multiplying and then they got
Thats the accuracy
When we have a problem like this we have to think what is it asking
We have to know how to solve and we have to be accurate
Theres a lot to these problems
Skylar can we take a quick glance at yours
Audience would you please put your eyes back to the screen
I did the same problem as Brendan since were partners and I used partial products but then when Brendan got a different answer from me he was using ladders so I decided to use some ladders so I could see if our answers were the same
Then he revised his thinking to be the same answer as mine and we got 4 x 3 x 16 because for the singing group there was four performers three hours and 16 per hour
Then for the tumblers there was eight performers it was three hours and it was 22 per hour so then we took 8 x 3 to get 24 and 4 x 3 to get 12 and then 12 x 16 to get 192 and 24 x 22 to get 528 and then 528  192 equals
336
Then we estimated and we rounded 528 to 500
Because 500 is an easier number to work with
Thank you for sharing
Would you please give three claps to those two thinking partners
Thank you
My friends on the carpet Im going to tell you something I noticed
Every fourthgrader in here right now should have the number model the estimate and should show their thinking on the problem because were showing you four ways to do it right now
Say that again
We didnt get done so what should you do at the carpet right now if you didnt get done
Trying to finish off
Trying to finish
Were listening to how our friends solved so that we can go back to our own work and solve our own work
Were not just sitting here
We love listening to our classmates but the reason were listening to our classmates is
Why
To see each others thinking
I dont know
See each others thinking to help us at the carpet too so please keep adding on and revising your thinking at the carpet right now
Ms Parker and I are going to go round and check all your journals
If you noticed Skylar did it multiple times didnt she
She did it multiple times to make sure that she didnt make a tiny little mistake you know what I mean
To doublecheck yourself always especially with multiplestep problems
Hunter and Jake worked together
Were just going to show one journal right now because of time but Hunter and Jake their thinking was similar and together so Hunter share with us how you solved
We started with our number model of the unknown
We had 8 x 3 x 22 represents the jugglers
Sorry the tumblers had eight performers three hours and 22 an hour
We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait
Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528
Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour
Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16
192
Because we did the estimate before we did our answer
My friends listen to this this is different than how I showed you
This is different and this is another successful strategy
Say that again Hunter
We did our estimate before our answer so that we could figure out our answer before we did it
You could say then Our answer is close to our estimate so we must be right
Okay
Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200
We took out 200 from 530 too and got 330 and then with our number model we did 528  192 and got 336 and since 336 is our answer we only need six off of our estimate
Can I have some questions comments or feedback for Hunter and Jake
The tables are off more
Yes I can try
I liked how you explained your work
You did it so it was easy to understand
Axel
Seeing yours and Skylars I just now saw that I forgot some steps so I went back and did it again
I like how you guys showed it like how Skylar showed it and Maddison and
Axel that took a lot of courage to say I really watched how you guys solved and I noticed a mistake or a step I left out
Are you going back and changing it right now in your journal
Yes
Fabulous
Thats what I want to see fourthgraders doing
Nice job my friend
All right so my friends I want to look up here at the success criteria
Look at your journal right now and you can look at Hunters thats on the screen too but look at yours
Do you have a single number model using parenthesis
That means right here this is Hunters number model
Look at yours
Do you have a single number model
If you dont fix it now and then we want to check our next part of success
Do you have an estimate to check yourself
See if youre answer is reasonable
Then do you have your answer with units
Hunter what is the answer and what is the units
33600
Thank you for sharing
Please give those two gentlemen three claps
Heres your job friends
What
I just realized that
My friends Ms Parker is it snack
Yes
Heres your job
Excuse me
Just a minute please Ill talk to you in just a second honey
You are going to do number two
The same thinking partner
Reverse whos the asking whos the answering but remember both of you were writing in your journals
You may do number two while youre eating snacks
You may sit around the room but Ms Parker when is recess
10 minutes
That is your time right now
10 minutes
You dont have any time to waste
Ready
Ready
Snack problem number two go
Excuse me
Yes
Do we estimate number two
You estimate number two question number two
