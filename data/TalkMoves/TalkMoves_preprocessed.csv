11749,5095,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,I know Dempseys answer was wrong because you dont subtract the denominator,,,555
11750,5096,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,You only subtract the numerator and we only do that if you have the same denominator,,,556
11751,5097,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,557
11816,5097,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,558

11826,5099,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,Allan pretty much said what I said but he added more to it so I dont really know,,,560
11827,5100,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,I said I know he is wrong because hes  which makes no sense because you have to get the denominator the same at all times,,,561
11828,5101,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,562
11893,5101,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,563

11977,5104,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Im going to explain something that really doesnt even have to do necessarily with the denominator that is a better answer than just saying that you dont subtract denominators,,,567
11978,5105,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Thats 100 true,,,568
11979,5106,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,You dont ever subtract denominators,,Revoicing,569
11980,5107,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,If theyre like if theyre different you do not subtract denominator,,,570
11981,5108,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,You dont add them either,,,571
11982,5109,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,572

12056,5110,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,That piece Im not disagreeing but heres why what makes it a better answer using your math sense,,,574
12057,5111,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,575
12122,5111,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,576
12131,5112,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,So I have 1320 and I have 25 equals 1115,,,577

12206,5114,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,This I just want to tell you that this right here is a little bigger than a half 1320 is a little bigger than a half,,,580
12207,5115,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,25 is a little less than a half so Im almost at 0,,,581
12208,5116,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Because I didnt have the numbers here,,,582
12209,5117,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,583

12367,5129,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,I didnt say one thing about my denominators,,,597
12368,5130,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,But definitely wrong too,,,598
12369,5131,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,I know that this is wrong because of taking this number 1320 subtracting 25 my answer should be close to 0 my answer should be a little bigger than 0,Revoicing,,599
12370,5132,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,But not as big as a half,,,600

12446,5135,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Because everybody talked about denominators heres what I want you to write and I want everyone writing because  you can go over here back now with your paper,,,604
12447,5136,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,You dont have one of these,,,605
12448,5137,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Get a piece of paper,,,606

12514,5138,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,608
12523,5139,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Then Im going to write 1320 is a little bigger than 12 and 25 is a little less than 12,,,609
12524,5140,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,So if I subtracted them,,,610
12525,5141,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Robert and Piper I also want you to write this on your paper so you have it,,,611

12669,5147,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,619
12678,5148,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,If you subtracted the two fractions the difference See how Im using math language,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,620
12679,5149,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,The difference would be greater,,,621
12680,5150,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,Ms Carroll  not on the board for number four,,,622
12681,5151,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,than 0 but less than 12,,,623
12682,5152,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,I want you writing this note Karen,,,624
12683,5153,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,This is the answer that I was more looking for than just understanding that we dont add or subtract,,,625
12684,5154,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,This is the next level of answer,,,626
12685,5155,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,So with the denominator talking about the denominators if I were to give this I would give it a 25 where this would be more of a 35 answer,,,627
12686,5156,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,S,But technically most answers are correct,,,628
12687,5157,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Theyre correct but this is really what were looking for not that you understand you dont have to add or subtract denominators,,,629
12688,5158,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,I want you to understand more about what these fractions represent,,,630
12689,5159,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,631

12763,5160,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,So I guess what Im saying is knowing that we dont add or subtract denominators is maybe a fourthgrade answer,,,633
12764,5161,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,This is more a fifthgrade answer,,,634
12765,5162,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Im trying to get you guys to the fifthgrade plus answers,,,635
12766,5163,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.012920-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,636

13955,5616,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Im ready to start,,,49
13956,5617,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Im going to do math,,,50
13957,5618,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Math is going to be a little different today,,,51
13958,5619,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were going to try something a little different,,,52
13959,5620,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,First I want to look at the learning targets so you know what were doing,,,53
13960,5621,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Theres going to be a few different parts of math today,,,54
13961,5622,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were going to be going through some different things,,,55
13962,5623,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were not going to come up in groups today,,,56
13963,5624,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were going to do whole group but were going to be moving through some different things,,,57
13964,5625,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Today the learning target is I can practice strategies for finding common denominators and use common denominators to add and subtract fractions,,,58
13965,5626,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Day one we learned how to find common denominators,,,59
13966,5627,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were going to use that strategy and possibly some other strategies to help us now add and subtract the fraction,,,60
13967,5628,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,I know that I can understand this when I can make any list of equivalent fractions for each fraction until I found equivalent fractions with the common denominator see if one denominator is a multiple of others,,,61
13968,5629,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were going to play a game that has to do with multiples,,,62
13969,5630,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,If so its also a common denominator or multiply the two original denominators and use their product as a common denominator,,,63
13970,5631,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Right here when it says practice strategies these are the three strategies that were going to use,,,64
13971,5632,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,One you already did when you multiplied by a two by a three by a four,,,65
13972,5633,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,You did both of those,,,66
13973,5634,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Thats one of the strategies here,,,67
13974,5635,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Im going to show you two others today,,,68
13975,5636,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The first thing that I want us to do is look at this short little video,,,69
13976,5637,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,S,Short by being an hour long,,,70
13977,5638,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Right,,,71
13978,5639,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Scarlette and I decided to order a giant sandwich for lunch and split it,,,72
13979,5640,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Scarlette said we have to cut it in half,,,73
13980,5641,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,I reminded him that we can cut it in as many pieces as we want,,,74
13981,5642,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,As long as we create an equivalent fraction to one half well still get an equal share,,,75
13982,5643,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Lets take him through it step by step,,,76
13983,5644,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The first step is to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number,,,77
13984,5645,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,This is what we did yesterday,,,78
13985,5646,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Those of you that have turned it in everybody got a three,,,79
13986,5647,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,That tells me that you understood how to do this strategy,,,80
13987,5648,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,S,is mine in there,,,81
13988,5649,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,I dont know is it,,,82
13989,5650,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Ill have to look,,,83
13990,5651,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Step two,,,84
13991,5652,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,I told Scarlette it doesnt matter what number you use as long as you multiply the top and bottom with the same number,,,85
13992,5653,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Were starting with our fraction 12 because that means well each get an equal share of the sub,,,86
13993,5654,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Lets choose the number three and multiply it by the top and the bottom,,,87
13994,5655,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Now all we have to do is multiply to find the product,,,88
13995,5656,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,When you multiply 12 by 33 you get 36 12 and 36 are equivalent fractions,,,89
13996,5657,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,That means if we cut the sandwich in  pieces we would get three pieces each wed still be getting the samepair as if we had cut the sandwich in half,,,90
13997,5658,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,This was just a quick little thing the next thing that were going to do were not going to talk in between because we have a lot that I want to accomplish today and the talking in between is not going to be helpful,,,91
13998,5659,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The next thing that youre going to do with your table and I cant remember if weve played this game before but its called buzz games so you say buzz bizz or bizz buzz,,,92
13999,5660,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Heres what you do youre going to stand in a circle and youre going to choose a leader,,,93
14000,5661,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Henry put that away,,,94
14001,5662,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The leader can change each time you play and what youre going to do is youre going to pick any number between three and nine as the leader and the number if I picked three then thats the buzz number,,,95
14002,5663,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The leader also chooses the stop number if I picked 3 and my stop number was 30 then we know how long were going,,,96
14003,5664,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,You cannot pick a number past 100 for your stop number 100s the biggest that you can go,,,97
14004,5665,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Then the player to the left of the leader begins the game by saying one play continues clockwise each player saying either the next whole number or buzz,,,98
14005,5666,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The buzz number is three so it goes one two buzz,,,99
14006,5667,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Four five buzz then it keeps going,,,100
14007,5668,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,You will say buzz every time thats its a multiple,,,101
14008,5669,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Then if you decide to do biz buzz if you want to challenge it then the leader names two numbers,,,102
14009,5670,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,This first round just play buzz maybe do two to three rounds just playing buzz,,,103
14010,5671,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Then if you feel confident where you can add two numbers then you can play bizz buzz,,,104
14011,5672,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,The difference with biz buzz is with bizz buzz you have the buzz numbers six and the bizz numbers three here it goes,,,105
14012,5673,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,One two buzz if three is the bizz number,,,106
14013,5674,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Four five bizz buzz because three and six are multiple so itd be biz buzz,,,107
14014,5675,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Seven eight,Keeping Everyone Together,,108
14015,5676,TalkBack.Year1.Carroll.Spring.021020.xlsx,T,Bizz because its only a multiple of three,,,109

15107,6538,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.120619.xlsx,S,I say that because 125 is equivalent to 2 25 because 125 thats technicSSy 2 25 because 5x2 is 10 then if you take away 10 from 12 itd be 2 and there would be 2 left because there were 125,,,62
15108,6539,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.120619.xlsx,S,It would be 2 25 as well because 1 75 theres still more than 5 in the fifths column so you have to take away 5 from the 7 and put that into another whole to add onto the 1,,,63

15117,6548,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.120619.xlsx,S,They can both be correct because if the 1 would equal 5 and then the 7 would equal 7 then if you add those together its 125,,,72
15118,6549,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.120619.xlsx,S,Or you can keep the one and then 75 is an improper fraction so you would make that 1 25 so then youd add two of those together to get 2 and that would be 2 25,,,73
15119,6550,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.120619.xlsx,T,Okay people are agreeing that,,,74

16577,7489,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.121119-1.xlsx,S,I thought because if you look at see this section is in a blue and these sections are each 10 and they each are both filled up and then I looked at these sections and there was five but I realized one of the section is filled SS the way and there is three left and 3 minus 10 is 7 so I got 47,,,137

16579,7491,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.121119-1.xlsx,S,How did you know right way that it was 47,,,139
16580,7492,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.121119-1.xlsx,S,It was because there are four sections and they are SS filled with 10s and then there was another section that it was like a 10 it was five at the top then you realize it doesnt have the bottom filled up so its seven because its minus three its subtracting 3 from 10,,,140
16581,7493,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Fall.121119-1.xlsx,S,I should use that strategy too,,,141

23574,11152,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This method was more of the equation form taking the whole number multiplying it times the numerator and then dividing it by four,,,143
23575,11153,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Here I would have 36 divided by four which equals nine,,,144
23576,11154,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,That was the second way,,,145
23577,11155,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Rate how well you understand that way,Keeping Everyone Together,,146

24968,11957,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012920.xlsx,S,My model shows that it was 34 and 23 because  because thats the 26 because one two three four five six  34 here because thats four and then there was two spots here and it says you have to make into a rectangle so to give a right answer I shaded those two blocks  for the rectangle and then for the shaded rectangle I said that is,,,191
24969,11958,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012920.xlsx,S,Because the shaded rectangle that is 34 and then  I had to find the area of the shaded rectangle I got 24 because when you count the sixths is six by four so its 6 x 4 and that equals 24 then I just counted how many boxes I shaded and then I got six and then I just put is 24,,,192

24981,11970,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012920.xlsx,S,to just count the width because if you just count one two three four five six and then count the ones making the full length which is just one two three four and then that would be You have to do 6 x 4 because its six by four,,,204
24982,11971,TalkBack.Year1.Carter.Spring.012920.xlsx,S,you could do 6 x 4 which is 24 instead of just counting all the squares it would be more efficient or equivalent,,,205

26865,13164,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,The picture is a conjecture because it says that hes trying that he thinks in a continent is trying to balance the books so he thinks like hes guessing,,,189
26866,13165,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then is he just guessing randomly,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,190

26877,13176,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This is an obvious thing but how it relates to the idea of conjecture is that the man is not saying that the new accountant is trying to balance the books which by the way is a joke about accounting because as you will be learning with young AmeriTowne balancing the books and thats actually something weve done once so far this year is making sure that your records match the bank records,,,201
26878,13177,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats called balancingm like balancing your checkbook,,,202
26879,13178,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats like the joke of it but its conjecture because hes using his evidence,,,203
26880,13179,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Hes not just making a crazy guess,,,204
26881,13180,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Hes using what he sees and what he knows to make a prediction,,,205
26882,13181,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Now in the cartoon its supposed to be funny,,,206
26883,13182,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Its obvious,,,207

27177,13276,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Sasha,Keeping Everyone Together,,302
27178,13277,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,14 is bigger than 15 so,,,303
27179,13278,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I see what shes thinking,,,304
27180,13279,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Shes thinking if you did 15 plus 35 thatd be 45 which is closer to one and 14 is even bigger than that so itd be even bigger than and even be more close to one,Revoicing,Revoicing,305
27181,13280,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right,,,306
27195,13281,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I can see that,,,307
27196,13282,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The tricky thing about 14 is its smack in the middle of zero and half,,,308
27197,13283,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I think thinking about well 35 is closest to half but its a little bit over,,,309
27198,13284,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If Im going to put 14 to it which is even closer which is like smack in the middle thats going to bring it even closer to one,,,310
27199,13285,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Does that make sense too,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,311
27200,13286,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,So thinking about it I think Sasha had a really great way of visualizing it and then also when you have 14 its tricky because its right in the middle,,,312

27236,13305,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,I dont think 12 is the correct answer because 3 and 38,,,331
27237,13306,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Annie sorry,,,332
27238,13307,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Because 38 is close to a half is closest to 12 so thats like already almost 12 and then plus 1 25 wold be way more than half,,,333
27239,13308,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Is 1 23 over a half,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,334
27240,13309,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Yes,,,335

27242,13311,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,So half doesnt make sense because one of my digits is already way over a half,,,337
27243,13312,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,One of my digits is already closest to what number,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,338

27246,13315,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,1 23 is already bigger than 1 12 and Im adding even more to that,,,341

27859,13674,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,Multiply the two original denominators and use their products as a common denominator,,,7
27860,13675,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,All right the lesson you guys did on Monday or Tuesday with Mrs Porter you did a really great job almost every single person got a three on the exit slip,,,8

27862,13677,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Were going to be using that idea today to continue our work with finding common denominators,,,10
27863,13678,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Im going to be teaching you several different ways to find common denominators were going to start with a little video to get you guys your brains into,,,11
27864,13679,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,Are those pies for the bake sale,,,12
27865,13680,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,I sure like pie,,,13
27866,13681,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Please,,,14
27867,13682,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Oh youre Dan and Jonah I want to know how to add and subtract fractions from Joshua,,,15
27868,13683,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Pies are perfect for talking about fractions,,,16
27869,13684,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,As you can see this is one pie thats one part of one whole or one over one in fraction form,,,17
27870,13685,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,If I cut the pie right down the middle I get two pieces each piece is one divided by two or one half of the whole,,,18
27871,13686,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,One half plus one half equals two halves or one whole,,,19
27872,13687,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,In a fraction the numbers have names the top number is the numerator and the bottom number is the denominator,,,20
27873,13688,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The denominator tells us how many pieces make up one whole the numerator tells us how many of those pieces were dealing with,,,21
27874,13689,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The two in this case is a common denominator shared by both fractions,,,22
27875,13690,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,When you add fractions with the same denominator you add the numerators while the denominator stays the same,,,23
27876,13691,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Each of these pieces is one divided by four or one fourth of the whole we can see that one fourth plus one fourth equals two fourths or one half,,,24
27877,13692,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Lets say we want to add one fourth of this pie to one half of another one,,,25
27878,13693,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Cutting pie one fourth and one half are fractions with different denominators,,,26
27879,13694,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,To add them we need to find their LCD or lowest common denominator,,,27
27880,13695,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Its basically the lowest common multiple of the fractions denominators,,,28
27881,13696,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,For our denominators two and four that number is four we want to write all of our fractions as fractions of four,,,29
27882,13697,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,One fourth already is and as we saw before one half and two fourths are really the same thing,,,30
27883,13698,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now that we have a common denominator we can just add the numerators two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths,,,31
27884,13699,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Subtraction is the same idea,,,32
27885,13700,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,As long as we have a common denominator its just a matter of subtracting the numerators,,,33
27886,13701,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,If we dont have a common denominator we find the lowest common denominator and rewrite our fractions to match,,,34
27887,13702,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Heres a good example,,,35
27888,13703,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Last year Jonahs pies were the highest selling items in the bake sale in fact five ninths of all the students in our school bought them but the year before only five twelfths of the school bought the pies,,,36
27889,13704,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Come on it was the first year you made them people didnt know how good they were yet,,,37
27890,13705,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Anyway to find out what fraction of students bought the pies the second year but not the first year we would subtract five twelfths from five ninths,,,38
27891,13706,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The denominators are nine and 12 whats the LCD,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,39
27892,13707,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Good 36,,,40
27893,13708,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Thats the lowest number that both nine and 12 multiply into evenly,,,41
27894,13709,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Lets rewrite our fractions as fractions of 36,,,42
27895,13710,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Lets see to turn nine into 36 we need to multiply by four which means we also have to multiply the numerator by four and to turn 12 into 36 we multiply by three which means we can also multiply five by three,,,43
27896,13711,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now we can just subtract the numerators to get our answer between last year and the year before your sales increased by five 36ths,,,44
27897,13712,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,All these pies we cut up theyre going to go bad unless I eat them,,,45
27898,13713,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Oh no this is your fault for making so many pies,,,46
27899,13714,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I want you to take a moment to think please and I want you to think what is something I already knew from that video that it reminded me,,Pressing for Reasoning,47

28530,14182,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Then I might say 15 minus four equals,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,531
28531,14183,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,,,,532
28532,14184,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The denominator stays the same so it is 18,,,533

28542,14194,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Hey good job,,,543
28543,14195,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,You tricked me,,,544
28544,14196,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Actually for some reason I was  my head because I thought,,,545
28545,14197,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,All right,,,546
28551,14198,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Okay thank you,,,547
28552,14199,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I ll fix them,,,548
28553,14200,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now you keep talking,,,549
28554,14201,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I gave you a ton of hints for yours Ivy,,,550
28555,14202,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Its up on the board what you need to tell her,,Keeping Everyone Together,551
28556,14203,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,That should be finished so she can move on and tell you,,Keeping Everyone Together,552
28557,14204,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,If Im being a Sage and I notice what shes doing Well first of all you told her four times two and one times two,Keeping Everyone Together,Revoicing,553
28558,14205,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,But Im confused thats why Im multiplying one times two,,,554
28559,14206,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Because if I do one times two I have to do two times two and that only gets me a denominator of four not 14,,,555
28560,14207,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So if Im going to be for Sage Id start just with this fraction and Id say multiply the numerator of four times two and put that as your new numerator,,,556
28561,14208,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,All right keep going guys,,,557
28562,14209,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Good job,,,558
28563,14210,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Multiply the numerator four times two,,,559
28564,14211,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So right here next to it write times two,,,560
28565,14212,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Youre making yourself do more work than you need to because its already there,,,561
28566,14213,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now that makes my new numerator so make a new fraction right here with your new numerator as eight,,,562
28567,14214,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,It s my numerator so if I look at my work up here  is the numerator on the top of the fraction or in the bottom,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,563
28568,14215,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The top,,,564
28569,14216,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,You want to put it when you write it on the top okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,565
28570,14217,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now Im going to do my denominator seven times two,,,566
28571,14218,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Well you cant write 14,,,567
28572,14219,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I didn t tell you to write 14,,,568
28573,14220,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I told you to write seven times two,,,569
28574,14221,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now seven times two equals 14 thats my new denominator,,,570
28575,14222,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Okay so my question is why are your fractions crazy wonky like that,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,571
28576,14223,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,You want your fractions to look like this okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,572
28577,14224,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I know but youve got to then tilt your book differently so it comes out straight,,,573

28590,14237,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Ive seen that coming through both of those things people not being specific and people really struggling at what to say,,,586
28591,14238,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So if you havent struggled at what to say that probably shows you have a clear understanding of it,,,587
28592,14239,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Remember I said I wanted to work on your board on there,,,588

28594,14241,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I look at our time were going way over our math time and we need to wrap it up and you doing SageNScribe is making it go a little longer,,,590
28595,14242,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So if you and your partner want to continue SageNScribe go for it if youve got a jam and youre doing good otherwise I want you to just work together to solve,,,591
28596,14243,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Asking questions if you and your partner are stuck,,,592

28603,14250,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,She already told you how to do this one,,,599
28604,14251,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I was there when she told you how to do that one,,,600
28605,14252,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I was totally there when she told you not to do that one,,,601
28606,14253,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Well maybe she moved on to this one because this one she told you that denominator was 18 remember,Keeping Everyone Together,,602
28607,14254,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,And she told you the numerator was 19,,,603
28608,14255,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,You even wrote it,,,604
28609,14256,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So numerator is 19 because were taking five plus 13 okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,605
28610,14257,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now this one you are subtracting,,,606
28611,14258,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So now were working together though Ivy so you dont have to worry about the SageNScribe piece,,,607
28612,14259,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,What is it going to be if Im subtracting these two,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,608
28613,14260,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,And that one I have up on the board,,,609
28614,14261,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,See the 1518 minus 418 up on the board,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,610
28615,14262,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So why dont you write that right here and write this,,,611

28619,14266,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,This 1518 came because 56 is the same as 1518,,,615
28620,14267,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Then the second number,,Pressing for Accuracy,616
28621,14268,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,418 yes,,,617
28622,14269,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Thats why we put them in that order,,,618
28623,14270,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Okay so I disagree with what you wrote down,,,619
28624,14271,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Thats not following our strategy so erase,,,620
28625,14272,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The answer is already up there too,,,621
28626,14273,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Then thats going to go right here,,,622

28636,14278,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,See the four and the 12 there,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,627
28637,14279,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,We already know that the common denominator is 12 because we did that work together,,,628
28638,14280,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,How Im I going to find the equivalent fractions for 34 what do I need to do,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,629
28639,14281,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Can I see one of your whiteboards and markers,,,630
28640,14282,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Aha there we go,,,631
28641,14283,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So its is 24 to 30 how big of a jump is that,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,632
28642,14284,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Ive got 34 I know I need a common denominator of 12,,,633
28643,14285,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,What do I need to do,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,634
28644,14286,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,Wait is that in right now,,,635
28645,14287,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Multiply You do count,,,636
28646,14288,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,You can count up there,,Keeping Everyone Together,637
28647,14289,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,See where it says the multiples of four Ivy,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,638
28648,14290,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,How many over is 12 if I count,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,639
28649,14291,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,More than two,,,640
28650,14292,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The four would be one the eight would be two the 12 would be what,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,641
28651,14293,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Three,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,642
28652,14293,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Three,,,643
28653,14294,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So I have to multiply always and this is where you made your mistake,,,644
28654,14295,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,The numerator and the denominator by three okay,Keeping Everyone Together,,645
28655,14296,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So next to here multiply just like I did by three,,,646
28656,14297,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So you write what I wrote here,,,647
28657,14298,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,Everyone is weird,,,648
28658,14299,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,S,If youre not weird then youre weird in a bad way,,,649
28659,14300,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now solve that,,Pressing for Accuracy,650
28660,14301,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Whats the new fraction going to be,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,651
28661,14302,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Notice how I wrote times three times three,Keeping Everyone Together,,652
28662,14303,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I want you to write that times three times three,,,653
28663,14304,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,So that way if you get stuck later you can go back to this one and,,,654
28664,14305,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,What did you get  fraction,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,655
28665,14306,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,But thats not a fraction,,,656
28666,14307,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Can you erase what you have please,,,657
28667,14308,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Youre making a fraction of Good keep doing,,,658
28668,14309,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Does this one need to change,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,659
28669,14310,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Whats the denominator,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,660
28670,14311,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Three times three equals what,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,661
28671,14312,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Four times three equals what,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,662
28672,14313,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,This is my new fraction,,,663
28673,14314,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,This is what I need to write in that,,,664
28674,14315,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Now this one already has the denominator of 12 so I just rewrite it,,,665
28675,14316,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,I dont have to change anything,,,666
28676,14317,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Okay now were adding but were not adding that problem Okay Ill be there in a second,,,667
28677,14318,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Were not adding this problem were adding our new numbers,,,668
28678,14319,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022020.xlsx,T,Were adding these two numbers,,,669

28814,14421,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Well a mixed number is made up of a nonzero integer and a fraction,,,45
28815,14422,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,1 12 2 34 27 38 these are all examples of mixed numbers,,,46
28816,14423,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Moby and I are working on a mixed number right now,,,47
28817,14424,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Were supposed to add 2 12 liters of oil for the car 2 12 really means 2  12,,,48
28818,14425,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Converting a mixed number to a fraction is just a matter of adding two fractions,,,49
28819,14426,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Well look at 2 12,,,50
28820,14427,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,To add 2 and 12 we write 2 as a fraction with a denominator of 2,,,51
28821,14428,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,2 is the same thing as 42,,,52
28822,14429,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Now adding them together is easy 42  12  52,,,53
28823,14430,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,A fraction like 52 with the numerator larger than the denominator is called an improper fraction,,,54
28824,14431,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,No theyre just called that,,,55
28825,14432,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,Theres a shortcut for converting mixed numbers to fractions,,,56

28827,14434,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,3 34 liters of oil,,,58
28828,14435,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,The shortcut is to multiply the whole number by the fractions denominator and then add the numerator to the result,,,59
28829,14436,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,We place that result over the denominator and get our improper fraction,,,60
28830,14437,TalkBack.Year1.Keene.Spring.022420.xlsx,T,4 x 3  12  3  15,,,61

31704,16518,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Standard form,,,221
31705,16519,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,No this is standard so when we factor it I used to call it factor form but the big idea has a different name for it,Revoicing,,222
31706,16520,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Standard,,,223
31707,16521,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Youre getting the right idea Chloe,,,224

31725,16529,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So if were in standard form and we factor it I used to call it factor form but what does it really tell us,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,232
31726,16530,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Whats the thing that factor form tells us,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,233
31727,16531,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,The intercepts,,,234
31728,16532,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,That it intercepts,,,235

31733,16537,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So if you werent listening to me you dont know youre supposed to start with five and six,,,240
31734,16538,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Were starting with this so that you get some practice refreshing your memory,,,241
31735,16539,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,How do you factor it when A is one,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,242
31736,16540,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,How do you factor it when A is not one,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,243
31737,16541,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Now I taught my classes factoring by grouping for this,,,244
31738,16542,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,That may be what you have,,,245
31739,16543,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,You might want to be referring to your math two toolkit I believe it would be in essential outcome too that you would find a toolkit on how you factored when the A value is something other than one,,,246
31740,16544,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So I want you to start with five and six,,,247
31741,16545,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,When you feel confident about those two then move on to problem number one two three and four,,,248
31742,16546,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,I havent factored,,,249
31743,16547,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Completing this,,,250
31744,16548,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Yes but were not going to complete the square of it,Revoicing,,251
31745,16549,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,I really like what you did,,,252
31746,16550,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Yes,,,253
31749,16551,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,You did factor by grouping basically although thered be a plus in between there,,Revoicing,254
31750,16552,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Thats the only thing,,,255
31751,16553,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,that would take longer to do,,,256
31752,16554,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Okay,,,257
31759,16555,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Well well compromise,,,258
31760,16556,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,and then you have X  5,,,259
31761,16557,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Do one we really need,,,260
31762,16558,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Okay,,,261
31763,16559,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Look at this one,,,262
31764,16560,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,This is five and six,,,263
31765,16561,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,multiplies to this as this,,,264
31766,16562,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,The hell,,,265
31767,16563,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Like the quadratic formula,,,266
31768,16564,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,No,,,267
31769,16565,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,No,,,268
31770,16566,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,We have B squared minus 4A over 2A minus,,,269
31771,16567,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Weve got the negative  but this is a positive,,,270
31772,16568,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,So I switched it and made it  and negative two plus five,,,271
31773,16569,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,So I did positive two and negative five and then,,,272
31774,16570,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Does that make sense,,,273
31775,16571,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,Yes,,,274
31776,16572,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Because its symmetrical so I have to add that much and subtract that much to find the point on either side of that,,,275
31777,16573,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So Ive got that but then I add the same amount subtract  that gives you my symmetry,,,276
31778,16574,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Thats,,,277
31779,16575,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,S,I have a negative,,,278
31780,16576,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,Right,,,279
31785,16577,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So that whole thing tells me,,,280
31786,16578,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,So that,,,281
31787,16579,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012320.xlsx,T,I have my vertex right here,,,282

32130,16833,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,How that works is you take the Front Range class and I think its Miss Butler that youd have to talk to,,,46
32131,16834,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Shell tell you the specific class,,,47
32132,16835,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,You would still sign up for this and then after the summer you take the trig precalc final pass that and then you could skip that and start cal fit,,,48
32133,16836,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The other requirement is that you have all As in all the maths classes in high school,,,49
32134,16837,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Is that the only class to do over the summer or is there like others,,,50
32135,16838,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The only reason that I know about that class is just because some people do want to skip in from math three and then be able to take calculus,,,51
32136,16839,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Over the summer you mean,,Revoicing,52

32152,16849,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right,,,63
32163,16850,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Lets put the problem number five first,,,64
32164,16851,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This is one of the problems where A is one,,,65
32165,16852,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The phrase we need to remember is factors of C that add up to B,,,66
32166,16853,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,We look at our C value over here,,,67
32167,16854,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Our systematic way of looking at factors is to just start with one and then two and three and four and five and we stop when we notice we already have a number even if its the opposite sign in my list,,,68
32168,16855,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This is a systematic way not to miss any of those and then with that set we also switch the signs,,,69
32169,16856,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The positive becomes negative and the negative becomes positive so well always have two sets to choose from,,,70
32170,16857,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then we want to find the one that adds up to B and so we look at these add them up and see which one it is,,,71
32171,16858,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then we absolutely have it easy because those numbers get stuck over here into our intercept form,,,72

32178,16865,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If my Y is zero if this is supposed to equal zero one of those two factors has to be zero,,,79
32179,16866,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The work we show is modeled here its called the zero product property,,,80
32180,16867,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Product means we are multiplying so we have our answer as zero a zero product property,,,81
32181,16868,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,We set it equal to zero and solve,,,82
32182,16869,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This is the kind of work you need to be used to doing,,,83
32183,16870,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then the Yintercept whats always true about a Yintercept,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,84

32186,16873,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,You could plug zero into here and immediately know what it is or you could put zero in here and we just be multiplying two times 5 and we come up with the same answer,,,87
32187,16874,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Now since level three or any constructed response problem is a communication between the two of us you have to show me work,,,88
32188,16875,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Now this looks like Do I really need to show work for this,,,89
32189,16876,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Yes show at least one step,,,90
32190,16877,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,It doesnt matter to me which one of the two standard or vertex forms you use but you should do something or lets just even say Y instead of F of X for this since were finding the Y value,,,91
32191,16878,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Just plug in zero for X and thats good enough to show the work for that,,,92
32192,16879,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,That would just means you know how to go about doing the math for that,,,93

32252,16909,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right so lets keep looking at this example,,,123
32253,16910,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If I know my two Xintercepts I know those two thats what Ive figured out so far and I know this guy down here my Yintercept,,,124
32254,16911,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,What do I know about my line of symmetry,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,125
32255,16912,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Its in the center of those,,,126
32256,16913,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If its in the center of those how do I find the center,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,127
32257,16914,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Average the root,,,128
32258,16915,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,We are going to average the root,Revoicing,Restating,129
32259,16916,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Remember root is just another name for Xintercepts and on the calculator the calculator uses the term zeros,,,130
32260,16917,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Zeros Xintercept root all mean the same thing were just to average them,,,131
32261,16918,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Now what if we werent able to factor it what do we do then,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,132
32262,16919,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,We use the opposite of B over 2A,,,133
32263,16920,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats the same thing,,,134
32264,16921,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats the first part of that quadratic formula is right here,,,135
32265,16922,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This is the opposite of B over 2A,,,136
32266,16923,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Its our line of symmetry and we have to add something and subtract something from it to find our Xintercepts,,,137
32267,16924,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right if we know the X value if we know our line of symmetry what do we do then to find the vertex,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,138
32268,16925,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,Plug the X value,,,139
32269,16926,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Yes we just plug that X value into the equation to find out what the vertex is and do that calculation,Revoicing,,140
32270,16927,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,At that point we have one two three four points,,,141
32271,16928,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Those are the key points we would be looking for and because we know that line of symmetry we know this one and can graph that and then we just connect the dots,,,142
32272,16929,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right,,,143
32283,16930,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Person number one survey your team find out if they have any questions about any of that starting from the top going down,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,144
32284,16931,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right any questions,Keeping Everyone Together,,145
32285,16932,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right problem number six,,,146
32286,16933,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The difference is our A value,,,147
32287,16934,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,We dont have a 1 anymore,,,148
32288,16935,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Now back in the day I never heard about factoring by grouping when I was in high school,,,149
32289,16936,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I would do guess and check,,,150
32290,16937,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If I look at this first term my choices were either to multiply 6X times X or 2X times 3X,,,151
32291,16938,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Nice with these numbers I only had two options which to try to figure out,,,152
32292,16939,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then Id look at this last term here and know that these two have to be multiplied to end up with this and Id just start guessing which combination of numbers that I would need,,,153
32293,16940,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Fortunately if youre pretty intuitive this might actually work for you but youve got to show me some kind of work that shows that you understand the things that you have to multiply together to get our first term the things we multiply together to get the last term and then its all about figuring out which combination would add to 1X here,,,154
32294,16941,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The system though that we have is to do factoring by grouping,,,155
32295,16942,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This phrase has only changed a little bit,,,156
32296,16943,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The factors of A times C so instead of saying the factors of C its the factors of A times C,,,157
32297,16944,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,In fact if you just memorize this when A is 1 its still the same thing,,,158
32298,16945,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Actually this is probably the phrase to learn if youre going to learn just one,,,159
32299,16946,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The factors of A times C that add up to B,,,160
32300,16947,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,A times C 12 list out all my factors do my second set find out what B is which one adds up and then the difference is that these two numbers are about how I split my linear term,,,161
32301,16948,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,In other words those two numbers are not my factors those two numbers is how I split this because 3 and 4 they add up to 1,,,162
32302,16949,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If I have 3X and 4X of this I havent changed my equation or anything,,,163
32303,16950,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats what my standard format looks like,,,164
32304,16951,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Ive split my linear term into those two,,,165
32305,16952,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then I look at these first two and say Well what could I factor out,,,166
32306,16953,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I can factor out the 3X and whats left behind is here,,,167
32307,16954,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,This guy times this it has to equal that this guy times this is equal that then over here what can I factor out of this,Pressing for Accuracy,,168
32308,16955,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Once Ive done that notice that whats in parentheses is the same thing thats what were looking for,,,169
32309,16956,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Because then I can pull out of this and put it in front,,,170
32310,16957,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Once I pull this out and put it in front what am I left with,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,171
32311,16958,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,S,3X2,,,172
32312,16959,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Its just that,,,173
32313,16960,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Theres my two factors,,,174
32314,16961,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then I use that zero product property I said this guy equal to zero,,,175
32315,16962,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I said that guy equal to zero and solve,,,176
32316,16963,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Those are my two Xintercepts,,,177
32317,16964,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right any questions on that part,Keeping Everyone Together,,178
32318,16965,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right,,,179
32329,16966,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Then looking at the green my line of symmetry Ive got my two Xintercepts so I add them up and divide by 2 that gets a little trickier with the fractions so Ive got to convert these to a common denominator,,,180
32330,16967,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,346 gives me the 16 and Im dividing by 2 and I wrote it this way because you might remember that when you divide you can change it to multiplication if you flip the second term so you copy change and flip,,,181
32331,16968,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,I dont know if you might have heard that before,,,182
32332,16969,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,Thats how it makes it a little bit easier when were working with dividing fractions,,,183
32333,16970,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,If I know X how do I find Y I plug it in and I end up having my vertex and then Im ready to graph those points,,,184
32334,16971,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,The key difference with this is this phrase right here and the factors of A times C then add it to B,,,185
32335,16972,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,All right so questions on either of those,Keeping Everyone Together,,186
32336,16973,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.012420.xlsx,T,In fact Ill put both of them up there,,,187

32984,17439,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats why youre going to use in this case when you match this up with whatever graph it is youre going to use those Xintercepts to write an equation of that,,,70
32985,17440,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,Okay,,,71
32986,17441,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,So its up to you,,,72

33816,17913,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,From the top,,,556
33817,17914,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,So a couple of things to pull out of this,,,557
33818,17915,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Some polynomials can be factored,,,558
33819,17916,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,So for example when you were working this  in some of those division problems and there was a remainder what would that tell you about it being factorable,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,559
33820,17917,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Yes but if it can be factored then its going to be factored completely when I cant factor anymore basically,,,560
33821,17918,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Im left with unfactorable parts,,,561
33822,17919,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,So like for example when I look at the answer down here to this first example I cant factor Z plus 3 any further,,,562
33823,17920,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Right,,,563
33829,17921,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Its totally factored and so thats where you want to keep asking that question,,,564
33830,17922,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Can I factor it further,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,565
33832,17923,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Can I factor it further,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,566
33834,17924,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Am I done,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,567
33835,17925,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Particularly now that were looking at some more complex things we want to keep asking ourselves that question,,,568
33836,17926,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Example 1 finding a common monomial factor which means that theres got to be Ys in every term or X is in every term or Z is in every term,,,569
33837,17927,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,In other words were just simply going to come down and in the case of this first one we can factor out an X,,,570
33838,17928,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,The first step in the second one we could factor out a 3Y3,,,571
33839,17929,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,In this fourth one we could factor out a 5Z2,,,572
33840,17930,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,The first thing we want to do is always see if theres some sort of common factor,,,573
33841,17931,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats another vocabulary term we could use and factor that out,,,574
33842,17932,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Notice in this case we end up with a quadratic another quadratic another quadratic No,,,575
33843,17933,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats a cubic,,,576
33844,17934,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,What about,,,577
33845,17935,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,No that is a quadratic thank you,,,578
33846,17936,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,I dont have my glasses on,,,579
33847,17937,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,In all of these cases after we factor out that monomial we have a quadratic so we have to use our skills for,,,580
33848,17938,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,You can use synthetic divisions,,,581
33849,17939,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Then theres synthetic division,Revoicing,Revoicing,582
33850,17940,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats on that option as well,,,583
33851,17941,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Any questions on that example,Keeping Everyone Together,,584
33852,17942,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats stuff that we have been doing,,,585
33853,17943,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Here in the core concept are some pattern,,,586
33854,17944,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Again these patterns Please dont play with the mic,,,587
33855,17945,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Okay thatll be all,,,588
33856,17946,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thanks,,,589
33857,17947,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Notice here that weve got the addition or the sum of two cubes or the difference of two cubes the subtraction and notice that the first step in solving those using this pattern is to write them as two cubes,,,590
33858,17948,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,There are some problems that we can look at and we have to learn to see that those are two cubes each of those and then be able to rewrite it in that form,,,591
33859,17949,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Then I actually know what A and B are,,,592
33860,17950,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,A is 3X and B is this 2 and then we just simply apply the pattern,,,593
33861,17951,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,If we look we can see that if in the sum I keep that sign,,,594
33862,17952,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,If its a difference I keep the subtraction sign and notice the pattern of the quadratic thats left,,,595
33863,17953,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Its really the same pattern just with that different sign,,,596
33864,17954,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,See that if I was getting a sum that first term is a subtraction and so those are going to be opposite signs in that case,,,597
33865,17955,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,We want to look for that pattern and thats just exactly whats happening here with Example 2,,,598
33866,17956,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Weve got to recognize that these are two cubes,,,599
33867,17957,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Rewrite them as cubes and then just simply apply that pattern,,,600
33868,17958,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats one skill for helping you move a little bit more quickly through the test is if you start to recognize those patterns,,,601
33869,17959,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Pete could you read this for me,Keeping Everyone Together,,602
33870,17960,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,For some polynomials you can factor by grouping pairs of terms that are of common monomial factor,,,603
33871,17961,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,S,The pattern for factoring by grouping is shown below,,,604
33872,17962,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Weve already done factor by grouping because that was one of our skills for factoring quadratics,,,605
33873,17963,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Remember we would find the factors of A x C and we would split the linear term,,,606
33874,17964,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Then we would look for a way of factoring the first terms and the second terms,,,607
33875,17965,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Ill show you the example,,,608
33876,17966,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,If we end up with a common factor here then I can pull that out as a separate factor and what am I left with,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,609
33877,17967,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Is the Z2  4,,Pressing for Accuracy,610
33878,17968,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats a valid skill for some and thats why I want to emphasize some,,,611
33879,17969,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Its not one that we can count on because for example what if this had been 19,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,612
33880,17970,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Well then I wouldnt have been able to do this type of factoring,,,613
33881,17971,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,That is something that we could look at as a strategy but its not going to work all the time,,,614
33882,17972,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Factoring polynomials in quadratic form,,,615
33883,17973,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,I want to go back to this example recognizing that this is two cubics,,,616
33884,17974,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Its X3 and 53,,,617
33885,17975,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,When we get to this Example number 4 Im recognizing that I could rewrite something in a quadratic form,,,618
33886,17976,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,For example this is the difference of two perfect squares,,,619
33887,17977,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Its two perfect squares,,,620
33888,17978,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Notice how Ive rewritten this term as a square and Ive rewritten this term as a square and then I apply the pattern that we learned with quadratics the difference of two squares,,,621
33889,17979,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Well thats my A and my B and so I factor those but then I have to ask myself can I factor this,,Pressing for Accuracy,622
33890,17980,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Can I factor that,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,623
33891,17981,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Well this ends up being another difference of two squares,,,624
33892,17982,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Thats a perfect square and thats a perfect square so I could factor those,,,625
33893,17983,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,This second example might be a little bit trickier for us to see,,,626
33894,17984,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,We look at this and at first we can find a common factor and so remember thats always the question that we have to ask,,,627
33895,17985,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-1.xlsx,T,Is there a common factor I can pull out,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,628

34301,18330,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Well start back then at 20 after if you want to step out in the hallway thats fine I do need to know if youre going to go down the hallway to go to the bathroom or get a drink let me know because I dont want a lot of people going down there and make sure you stay down to the left of our door here just so that were not bothering the other classes,,,202
34302,18331,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Yes then you use parentheses,,,203

34306,18334,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,S,How else would you do it,,,206
34307,18335,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Since A is 1 its also the factors of C that add up to B that would give it to me right away,,,207
34308,18336,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,S,Wait so then we just group,,,208
34309,18337,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,If I looked at this and applied this idea,,,209
34310,18338,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Yes so x4 its your factor form,,,210
34311,18339,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,There you go,,,211

34316,18341,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Yes go ahead  example two the difference  Oh you know what,,,213
34317,18342,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Im confused about how to do that one too because its missing something  yes go ahead  its supposed to be 25 in other words if its two squares then I should be able to write each term as a square,,,214
34318,18343,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Whats the square root of 25,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,215

34323,18348,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Now I want to write this one as something squared 8X2,,,220
34324,18349,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,A power to a power means that that would be X to the fourth and 8 times 8 is 64 so that gets me the setup the way its supposed to look then look what happens here its AB and AB in my case thats A and thats B,,,221
34325,18350,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Then I also have to ask myself though can I now factor this further,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,222
34326,18351,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Now this applies the difference of two squares which is really what this is about but if I want to keep going,,,223
34327,18352,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,S,You can factor X2,,,224
34328,18353,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Yes I can factor X2 out of everything I would do that then keep going and I could have done that over here too I could have looked at what could I factor out first and factor out the X to the fourth then Im left with,Revoicing,Revoicing,225

34415,18433,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Oh no thats not right even sorry,,,307
34416,18434,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,I was thinking about something,,,308
34417,18435,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,This is a whoops its minus,,,309
34418,18436,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Ill eventually get there,,,310
34419,18437,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,ab2 which is what we see here,,,311
34420,18438,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,See how those are the repeated roots of those,,,312
34421,18439,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,its recognizing the pattern of a perfect square which then tells me exactly how I can rewrite this,,,313
34422,18440,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Now we ought to ask the question again,,,314
34423,18441,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Can I factor this guy,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,315
34424,18442,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Well thats the difference of two squares,,,316
34425,18443,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,x2 perfect square difference meaning subtraction four I think that might be in this as well,,,317

34435,18453,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Lets turn back over to page 146,,,327
34436,18454,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,S,What page,,,328
34437,18455,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,,,,329
34438,18456,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Yes sorry about that,,,330
34439,18457,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Page 136,,,331
34440,18458,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,All right 136 the first example is actually a whole lot simpler,,,332
34441,18459,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Were just pulling out whatever common factor we find in this case an x,,,333
34442,18460,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,This gets a little more sophisticated,,,334
34443,18461,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,When I look at this recognizing I have a 3y3 that I could pull out and then looking over here recognizing I have a 5 z2,,,335
34444,18462,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Thats all this first example is is learning how to pull out the right thing,,,336
34445,18463,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Then heres the factoring with a is one another factoring where I have the difference of squares,,,337
34446,18464,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Then recognizing here that pattern that we just got through talking about of a perfect square,,,338
34447,18465,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,If I look at z and 9 those are both perfect squares so z x 3 x 2 gives me the middle term and so I need to start recognizing those patterns so that I can do that,,,339
34448,18466,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Let me check something really quick,,,340
34449,18467,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Havent talked about that one yet,,,341
34450,18468,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Then heres the next pattern we just got through talking about the difference of two squares and this would be the difference of two cubes and this is the sum of two cubes,,,342
34451,18469,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,We can factor a2  b2 this would be the sum of two squares not cubes,,,343
34452,18470,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Oops I dont want the plus I want the minus,,,344
34453,18471,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,This one there is no factor yet,,,345
34454,18472,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,This one is x,,,346
34455,18473,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Weve got the sum and difference not only of squares but of cubes but this one cannot be factored so you dont have to worry about trying to factor that,,,347
34456,18474,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,These are also patterns then that we want to start to get accustomed to is recognizing if those are perfect cubes like 8 or y3 then this is the pattern that we follow,,,348
34457,18475,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Looking here whats the cube root of this,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,349
34458,18476,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Its 4x whats  1,,Pressing for Accuracy,350
34459,18477,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Its 1,,,351
34460,18478,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Notice the first step is to rewrite these as cubes instead of keeping it like this,,,352
34461,18479,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,What I want you to do is on that toolkit isthis is the title of the next section on your toolkit so special factoring patterns and theres the sum of two cubes with an example for you to work on there,,,353
34462,18480,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,The first step is to write those in the formula,,,354
34463,18481,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Its very easy for us to recognize the cube not too tricky here just the a,,,355
34464,18482,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,What would be  27,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,356
34465,18483,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,So 3 x 3 is 9 9 x 3 is 27 just doublechecking,,,357
34466,18484,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Now I know that according to this little pattern thats my a value that Im going to use here thats my b value,,,358
34467,18485,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Thats really as much as I can copy from the pattern that I see here thats this pattern,,,359
34468,18486,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Im adding a and b,,,360
34469,18487,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Adding a and b those are my as and bs fill that in,,,361
34470,18488,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,My first term in the second parentheses is a2 then Im subtracting multiplying a and b together so the a x 3 3a and then I have to square my b value,,,362
34471,18489,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Thats following the pattern of the sum of two cubes,,,363
34472,18490,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,The next one is the difference of two cubes,,,364
34473,18491,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Then talk with your partner,Keeping Everyone Together,Keeping Everyone Together,365

34476,18494,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Heres a term that youre used to but its a little different application factor by grouping,,,368
34477,18495,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Factor by grouping is the way that we would factor a quadratic that had an a value that wasnt one,,,369
34478,18496,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,In other words the x2 with something like 4x2 or 6x2 and were trying to figure out how to factor when that a value is not one,,,370
34479,18497,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,The concept is exactly the same but heres an emphasis on this word right there,,,371
34480,18498,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,Hallway partner give some emphasis to that word as you read that little paragraph to your hallway partner,,Keeping Everyone Together,372

34492,18510,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,The whole idea here is that I want to come up with those two being the same so that I can pull that out in a sense by itself,,,384
34493,18511,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,After I pull that out what am I left with is the z24,,,385
34494,18512,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,The interesting thing about this one is because I think once we did that we might think Oh were done,,,386
34495,18513,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020320-2.xlsx,T,This guy right here can be factored because it is the difference of two squares,,,387

35221,19143,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,Fairly straightforward,,,103
35222,19144,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,If my leading coefficient is something other than 1 then Im going to really increase the number of options for what the factors could be,,,104
35223,19145,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,Our first example is with a 1,,,105
35224,19146,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,It simplifies the number of fractions of possible factors,,,106
35225,19147,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,Then the second example well have something other than 1 for the leading coefficient and I just havent picked that one yet,,,107
35226,19148,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,The only thing right now we have for this toolkit is just what I gave you,,,108
35227,19149,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,Now it might be interesting to note on here as a way of studying and looking for patterns is to whether or not were modifying X or were modifying the whole function,,,109
35228,19150,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.020620-1.xlsx,T,For example when I look at this am I modifying X or the whole function,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,110

35733,19612,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,I did eliminate several of the problems from the review because youre not responsible for those so not every problem from the review is there but most of the problem I think its might be 32 of them or something like that,,,24
35734,19613,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,S,For the quiz is it just like 38 or is it like the cumulative like that,,,25
35735,19614,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Its a wee bit cumulative so the primary emphasis is why Im factoring and solving but theres a little vocabulary stuff in there,,,26
35736,19615,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,I think its 12,,,27

35775,19654,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Thered have to be a zero somewhere in there so that means theres an Xintercept at onepointsomething in this particular case,,,66
35776,19655,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Again this is just more about being able to analyze graphs,,,67
35777,19656,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Since were not using calculators on the test Im not going to spend much more time on this but you get the concept and thats all I really want to expose you to is that concept,,,68

35814,19693,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,So up here we were looking at the degree of the polynomial,,,105
35815,19694,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Here Im looking at the Xintercepts the zeros the roots the solution kind of thing and so I see one two three four Xintercepts and I have one two three one less,,,106

35819,19698,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,It also depends though where this polynomial function is,,,110
35820,19699,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,It could be that actually all my turns are up here and I only have one and thats why you see the word exactly for this particular one cause weve counted the number of Xintercept versus at most that particular number of turning points,,,111
35821,19700,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Whats in Italics right there also becomes important,,,112

35823,19702,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Again more conceptual understanding seeing relationships of polynomial equations and graphs and well skip over these,,,114
35824,19703,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,This is one that were going to do a little bit of work on and thats something called even and odd function,,,115
35825,19704,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Now dont confuse that with even and on degree,,,116
35826,19705,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Were still saying even and odd but its about either the degree that weve talked a lot about or in this case even or odd functions,,,117
35827,19706,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,You got to key in on that particular word and the even or odd degree,,,118
35828,19707,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,No thats not what were talking about here,,,119
35829,19708,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,What were talking about is an even function is symmetrical about the Yaxis,,,120
35830,19709,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,In other words if I took my graph and folded it right here on the Yaxis it would lay on top of each other,,,121
35831,19710,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Then an odd function is symmetrical about the origin,,,122
35832,19711,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,In other words if I took my curve and pinned it down right there and spun it 180 degrees it ended up laying on top of itself again,,,123
35833,19712,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,All right so two types of cemetery about the Yaxis if this is true well explain that in just a minute or about the origin if this is true,,,124
35834,19713,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,What we do mathematically notice that they both start with exactly the same thing,,,125
35835,19714,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Were going to plug in a negative X and then were going to manipulate it and see if I end up with my original function or I end up with the opposite of the original function,,,126
35836,19715,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,If I end up with something else then its neither an odd function or an even function,,,127
35837,19716,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,So what does that look like,Pressing for Accuracy,,128
35838,19717,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,If you want to turn in your text or just follow along on the screen here either will find youd be in the texts at page 171,,,129
35839,19718,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,This is our first one,,,130
35840,19719,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,I remember no matter what were testing we just plug in a negative X so every place that I see an X I put a parentheses,,,131
35841,19720,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Theres an X with the cube outside of it so thats what I do just the X but parentheses with the negative X in it,,,132
35842,19721,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Then the parentheses with the negative X here,,,133
35843,19722,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Then I got to do a little math,,,134
35844,19723,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Whats negative X times negative X times negative X going to be,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Accuracy,135
35845,19724,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Its going to be negative,,,136
35846,19725,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Cause right,Keeping Everyone Together,,137
35847,19726,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Im multiplying by three times itll still be a XQ,,,138
35848,19727,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,The negative times the negative here gives me a positive 7X and then I have to rewrite this to look like that,,,139
35849,19728,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,In other words to get this to look like that Ive got to factor out the negative sign,,,140
35850,19729,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,That becomes positive inside that becomes negative so theres my F of X I actually do have when I plug in a negative X I have the negative F of X,,,141
35851,19730,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,We determined them that its an odd function and going back to this an odd function we could say is symmetrical about the origin,,,142
35852,19731,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Again this is something that can help us in understanding what the graph should look like,,,143
35853,19732,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,If I do this type of test I know it should be symmetrical about the origin,,,144
35854,19733,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Thats the value of this,,,145
35855,19734,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Then we look at the next one,,,146
35856,19735,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Again Im just going to take this,,,147
35857,19736,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,My first step is rewriting this with parentheses every time I see an X and I plug in the negative X,,,148
35858,19737,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Now if I multiply negative X four times it ends up being positive and the negative X twice thats going to be positive,,,149
35859,19738,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Then I have the 1,,,150
35860,19739,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Well look at what I already have,,,151
35861,19740,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,I just ended up right back to my original function,,,152
35862,19741,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Thats the definition of how to test for an even one and that ones going to be symmetrical about the Yaxis,,,153
35863,19742,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,Only two types of symmetry that were testing Yaxis and about the origin,,,154
35864,19743,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,S,Why is it called odd or even though,,,155
35865,19744,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,S,Shouldnt it to be a positive or negative function,,,156
35866,19745,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,S,Thats really weird,,,157
35867,19746,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-1.xlsx,T,I know and but in a certain sense thats also what we thought of with odd and even degrees too though is positive and negative,Revoicing,,158

36381,20149,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,There are some problems like this that youll be working on,,,210
36382,20150,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,First read this disclaimer right here,,,211
36383,20151,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Weve talked about even and odd degrees but this is about even and odd functions,,,212
36384,20152,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Totally different terminology so we dont want to confuse them,,,213
36385,20153,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,The idea is if I have something called an even function its symmetric about the yaxis,,,214
36386,20154,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,When I look at this one right here if I fold my graph over on the yaxis thatll lay right on top of the other half of it,,,215
36387,20155,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Thats called an even function,,,216
36388,20156,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,An odd function is if its symmetrical about the origin,,,217
36389,20157,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,For example on this guy right here if I could kind of break it off right here and rotate this part around 180 degrees it would lay on top of that one,,,218
36390,20158,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,In other words I can kind of spin this on the origin symmetrical about the origin and itll lay on top of itself at some point,,,219
36391,20159,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Theres those two cases of an even and odd but theres also cases that neither is true,,,220
36392,20160,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,We end up having three different answers as possibilities to a prompt that asks if its even or odd or neither,,,221
36393,20161,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,How we test that is in the red box here,,,222
36394,20162,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,In both cases I take my function and I plug in negative x in the place of x,,,223
36395,20163,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Then I see if I end up with what I started with and I started with f I put in a negative x for x but if I end up with the same thing it is an even function symmetrical about the yaxis,,,224
36396,20164,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,For this guy I do exactly the same thing but my result is that I get basically the opposite of the original function,,,225
36397,20165,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,So in other words all of the signs have changed from positive to negative or negative to positive,,,226
36398,20166,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,If you want to turn in your book to page 171 theres this example but were also going over it on the board but if you want to follow it in your book,,,227
36399,20167,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Were going to start with this guy,,,228
36400,20168,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,In all cases says whenever I come to the x I put a parentheses,,,229
36401,20169,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,In other words Im going to put in a negative X in the place  Oops nothing there,,,230
36402,20170,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,This is the idea right here,,,231
36403,20171,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,When I see the x I just simply make parentheses and my negative x goes in there,,,232
36404,20172,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Thats what you see happening right here,,,233
36405,20173,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,We just stuck that in,,,234

36412,20180,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,It turns out notice how the signs are just simply the opposite right here,,,241
36413,20181,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,I can rewrite this by taking that negative sign out to be like factoring a negative one,,,242
36414,20182,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,This was my original f so its the opposite of f or the negative f,,,243

36427,20195,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Im not changing that plus two its right there,,,256
36428,20196,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,When I compare these two theres no way of factoring out a negative and getting back to this,,,257
36429,20197,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,I cant get back to this from that expression so thats neither,,,258

36477,20226,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,This is all about finding an equation,,,287
36478,20227,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,The only skill were going to cover is example number one,,,288
36479,20228,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,This is only in the textbook if you want to pull it out,,,289
36480,20229,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,All right page 176 if youre going to look in your books,,,290
36481,20230,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,All right this is a similar situation as weve done with quadratics where youve been given some information about some points that are on the quadratic and how to come up with that quadratic equations,,,291
36482,20231,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Only now were taking it to a cubic,,,292
36483,20232,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,For a cubic I might just have three factors,,,293
36484,20233,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Now on cubic though if I ended up multiplying all of this out my leading variables should be x3,,,294
36485,20234,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Now there might be some numbers here and a whole bunch of stuff after it but were looking for that x3 because its a cubic function,,,295
36486,20235,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,If you wanted to think of it as the fact that you actually have three factors because multiplying X times X times X is what would give x3,,,296
36487,20236,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Generically youre starting with a function thats going to have three factors and so if I look here and find my Xintercepts I can drop those right in to that red format,,,297
36488,20237,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,To remember its an X minus K type format,,,298
36489,20238,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,X minus negative four negative four was the actual Yintercept,,,299
36490,20239,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,I wouldnt leave it like that I would write that as X plus four but,,,300
36491,20240,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,you can see that the red represents the standard way of starting,,,301
36492,20241,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Now with these Xintercepts there are a lot of different cubics that could have those same X intercepts,,,302
36493,20242,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,For example I could have a cubic that does that and still goes through the exact same Xintercept,,,303
36494,20243,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,That means there has to be some sort of modifier as to whether or not its like this red one which is positive the blue one which is a negative reading coefficient so we have to find that Avalue,,,304
36495,20244,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,To find that Avalue we have to have some other point to put in,,,305
36496,20245,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,It may be a Yintercept or maybe its another point on the line,,,306
36497,20246,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,For example this point might just be four,,,307
36498,20247,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Lets see is that negative 12,Keeping Everyone Together,Pressing for Accuracy,308

36500,20249,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,It could be one where we have to look at a graph and go Oh you know what,,,310
36501,20250,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Thats right all those crosshairs of the grid so I can know with some confidence,,,311

36503,20252,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,I take my Y value and put it in here and I put my X values in the place of all of those and calculate it out,,,313
36504,20253,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Now this particular example though theyve told us what the Yintercept is,,,314
36505,20254,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,When I make all those X is zero it makes my calculations pretty easy,,,315
36506,20255,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,I dont have any big numbers that I have to be working with,,,316
36507,20256,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,The whole idea here is I plug in another point a different point it cant be an X intercept its got to be some other point that I plugin for Y and for X solve for A and then rewrite my equation,,,317
36508,20257,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Now when youre looking at any constructedresponse problems that have this kind of thing on the test pay close attention to the prompt,,,318
36509,20258,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,Does it tell you what kind of form to leave your answer in,,Pressing for Accuracy,319
36510,20259,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,If it doesnt tell you then leave it this way because that simple but if it says standard form you got to multiply that out and put it in standard form,,,320
36511,20260,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021020-2.xlsx,T,If I have or lets say its actually this way I have four I will make that a negative one half like that half,,,321

36895,20600,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Looking at this guy so this is our prompt,,,241
36896,20601,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Were starting with something that 7  8 isnt going to simplify,,,242
36897,20602,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,If this had been 32 for example up here then we want to do 32  8 all to the one fifth power type thing or the fifth root of 328 because we can simplify that,,,243
36898,20603,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,In this particular case were basically stuck not being able to simplify the 7 and the 8 at all and so were doing something called rationalizing the denominator,,,244
36899,20604,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,I have to come up with something to multiply it by so that I get a whole number answer,,,245
36900,20605,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Thats whats happening here,,,246
36901,20606,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,We have to figure out well whats our fancy form of one that were going to multiply by,,,247

36910,20615,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,In other words I shouldnt have eight as a cube root of eight shouldnt be part of my final answer because the cube root of eight equals two,,,256
36911,20616,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Now the cube root of four,,Pressing for Accuracy,257

36913,20618,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Yes so we leave it as t 4,,Revoicing,259
36914,20619,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,If youre leaving your answer with  24 where 8 is a factor of 24 you havent put it in simple form so thats what this first bullet is talking about,,,260
36915,20620,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,The second no radicands contain fractions,,,261
36916,20621,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Remember the radicand is the number inside underneath the radical so no fractions inside there,,,262
36917,20622,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Then the third one no radicals in the denominator,,,263
36918,20623,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Thats what we were just dealing with,,,264
36919,20624,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,This is an example where if I have a radical in the denominator how do I go about simplifying that,Pressing for Accuracy,Pressing for Reasoning,265
36920,20625,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,It turns out for this particular problem thats the only thing were doing is rationalizing the denominator,,,266
36921,20626,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Thats what its called rationalizing the denominator,,,267
36922,20627,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,The tricky part about rationalizing the denominator is just figuring out what form of the number one were going to multiply something by,,,268
36923,20628,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820(1).xlsx,T,Once we figure out what it is that goes in the denominator we just write the exact same thing in the numerator,,,269

37835,21365,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,The only thing to happen at this step is we just lost the one,,,637
37836,21366,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,We didnt need to have the one there,,,638
37837,21367,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,All right,,,639
37853,21368,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Dont get confused just because youve got something like this doesnt mean now were going to have it be 1 and 23 as the exponent but then which base would we choose or what would we do,,Pressing for Accuracy,640

37872,21372,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,All right then over here Im multiplying and Ive got powers to a power and its a negative guy,,,644
37873,21373,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Notice what happened,,,645
37874,21374,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Since my bases are different but I have a common exponent thats the first step that was first taken and I still have my negative 15,,,646

37876,21376,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,We went ahead and multiplied the 4 X 3 because this 5 is outside of the 4 X 3 so I can multiply the 4 X 3 and then since I have a power to a power I can multiply those which just equals 1 and so I end up here,,,648
37877,21377,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Right because Ive got to flip it over to the other side of the fraction bar,,,649
37878,21378,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Now a lot of times Ill see students thatll kind of forget that that one is left behind,,,650

37888,21388,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Then down here Im looking for step that makes sense and I notice that my exponents are the same so I can move that exponent outside of the parenthesis with still the power to a power here,,,660
37889,21389,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Power to a power but look at what I can do first,,,661

37894,21394,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Its about starting to be able to see what is the thing thats in common that I could use,,,666
37895,21395,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,In this case we have a common base,,,667
37896,21396,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Sometimes we had a common exponent that we could use,,,668

37902,21402,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,If Im multiplying inside of a radical I can split it up,,,674
37903,21403,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Or if Im multiplying two radicals I can go the other way and combine them,,,675
37904,21404,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,We have the one that was square root of three times the square root of twelve,,,676
37905,21405,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Yes it was the square root,,,677
37906,21406,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,So we could multiply the 3 X 12 and take the square root of 36 and come up with six,,,678
37907,21407,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Same property,,,679
37908,21408,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Multiplication and division you know typically they go handinhand so I can do that same sort of thing,,,680

38179,21590,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Adding and subtracting,,,865
38180,21591,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Weve talked about multiplying and dividing radicals,,,866
38181,21592,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Now were adding and subtracting,,,867
38182,21593,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,The only way I can combine these is because I have a common fourth root that Im taking,,,868
38183,21594,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Im taking  10,,,869
38184,21595,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,I have one of them here and I have seven of them here that means I have eight of these,,,870
38185,21596,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,In other words I can think about this as if its x 7x and I have 8xs,,,871
38186,21597,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Only now my x is actually the fourth root,,,872
38187,21598,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Then here its in exponent form but Ive got 2 of them here and Im adding 10 more so Ive got a total of 12 of them,,,873
38188,21599,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Its nothing more than 2x10x,,,874
38189,21600,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Here its a little bit different,,,875
38190,21601,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Right here theres not an obvious combination like I saw here but I can rewrite this guy as 27x2,,,876
38191,21602,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,We saw that 27 is one of our perfect cubes so the 3 comes out and Im then left with 3 square roots of 2 as a common element,,,877
38192,21603,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,I may have to modify something here before I see that I have some like terms that I can combine,,,878
38193,21604,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Again this is like 3x1x and so the 31 is there,,,879

38198,21609,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,When were working with radicals if were taking an odd root a cube root a fifth root seventh root that thing I dont have to worry about any particular change that the even one is calling for,,,884
38199,21610,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,In other words when Im taking an even root square root fourth root and so on my answer Im going to specify as being a positive value,,,885
38200,21611,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,For example if Im taking the  3 to the 4th my answer is the positive answer,,,886
38201,21612,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Thats one little tricky part to come into play and in this example right here where Im picking an even root I split my fraction rewrite this as something to the fourth power,,,887
38202,21613,TalkBack.Year1.Saunders.Spring.021820.xlsx,T,Instead of writing y to the eighth Im looking for how can I rewrite that as something to a fourth power so that I know what I can factor out and notice what happens in the numerator there,,Pressing for Accuracy,888

40736,22663,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,What I did I did two number lines,,,379
40737,22664,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,One is at half number line and the others are fourth number lines and I thought it was a bit easier to know one half is two fourths because two fourths is an equivalent fraction to a half and it would be easier to add it that way,,,380
40738,22665,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So I did two fourths plus one fourth equals three fourths and thats way you get as an answer,,,381

41135,22768,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,Mmhmm,,,488
41136,22769,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,A strategy Ive learned is when youre trying to find if the denominators of two different numbers are not like you cant put a 13 into a four or a four into a third,,,489
41137,22770,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So a strategy I learned is you multiply both of the denominators 3 times 4 together because then they can both its equivalent because four times three is 12 and that would be equivalent to three then would be how do I explain this,,,490
41138,22771,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,It would be an equivalent whatever you have will also be equivalent to that number 12 and then the same before,,,491
41139,22772,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So then what I did is because I kind of combined each other I did so three times four is equivalent four times three equivalent,,,492
41140,22773,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So I did the same thing,,,493
41141,22774,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,You have to do the same thing,,,494
41142,22775,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,1  4  4 and then 1  3  3,,,495
41143,22776,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So now it will be 412  312,,,496
41144,22777,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,Then you can have a common denominator the same one to add to the two numerators,,,497
41145,22778,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So four plus three would be seven,,,498
41146,22779,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,That will be 712,,,499

41153,22786,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,So thats what I did to,,,506
41154,22787,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,T,So if I was doing this up here perhaps I would think to myself How did you know you just multiply this denominator by this denominator,Pressing for Reasoning,Pressing for Reasoning,507
41155,22788,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.010920.xlsx,S,Because I knew if I multiplied them both together that they would both have a number multiplied by themselves that will be equal and a common denominator,,,508

51647,26812,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,We started with our number model of the unknown,,,783
51648,26813,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,We had 8 x 3 x 22 represents the jugglers,,,784
51649,26814,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Sorry the tumblers had eight performers three hours and 22 an hour,,,785
51650,26815,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,We actually do 22 x 24 since 8 x 3 is 24 so when we did that we were able to get that 20 x 20 is 400 20 x 4 wait,,,786
51651,26816,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Yes 20 x 2 is 40 20 x 4 is 80 and 4 x 2 is 8 so that we ended up getting 528,,,787
51652,26817,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Then we did 4 x 3 x 16 because the singing group had four performers three hours at 16 an hour,,,788
51653,26818,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Because 4 x 3 is 12 we did 12 x 16,,,789
51654,26819,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,192,,,790
51655,26820,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Because we did the estimate before we did our answer,,,791

51661,26826,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,T,Okay,,,797
51714,26827,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,Instead of yes Jake and rounding to hundreds we rounded to the tens so that 528 was 530 and 192 this one we just did 200,,,798
51715,26828,TalkBack.Year1.Travers.Spring.020620-2.xlsx,S,We took out 200 from 530 too and got 330 and then with our number model we did 528  192 and got 336 and since 336 is our answer we only need six off of our estimate,,,799
